description: Internationalize your React App in 5 minutes with General Translation
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [React](https://react.dev) project.

We will cover 4 simple steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Installing the required libraries
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Running the CLI setup tool
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Adding `<GTProvider>` to your app
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Setting up your local environment
    </Step>
</Steps>

This entire process should take under **5 minutes**.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react) and [gt-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react-cli) libraries.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i gt-react-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add gt-react-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add -d gt-react-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add -D gt-react-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


### 2. Run our CLI tool

Run the [gt-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react-cli) tool to setup your project for translation.

This will scan your codebase for translatable content and automatically wrap it in `<T>` components.

```bash title="shell" copy
npx gt-react-cli setup
```

See the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/react/reference/cli#setup) for more information.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Experimental:**
  We are currently experiencing issues with automated translations setup for string content.
  If you run into issues, please follow [this guide](/docs/react/tutorials/translating-strings) for translating strings.
</Callout>


### 3. Add `<GTProvider>`

[`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is used to configure the behavior of `gt-react`. 
It should be placed as high up in your app as possible, ideally at the root.
Just add the list of [locale codes](/docs/reference/supported-locales) you want to support as a prop.

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider locales={['fr', 'zh']}> // French and Chinese support // [!code highlight]
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```

For a full list of `<GTProvider>` props and extended documentation, see the [API reference](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).

### 4. Set up your local environment

Add your API key and Project ID to your environment variables.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/dashboard).
            * Navigate to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the Project ID and API Key to your environment variables.
        Depending on your React framework, the environment variables may look slightly different.
        These instructions are for **DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENTS ONLY**.
        <Tabs items={["Vite", "Gatsby", "RedwoodJS", "create-react-app", "Other"]}>
            <Tab value="Vite">
            ```bash copy
            VITE_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            VITE_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="Gatsby">
            ```bash copy
            GATSBY_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            GATSBY_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="RedwoodJS">
            ```bash copy
            REDWOOD_ENV_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            REDWOOD_ENV_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="create-react-app">
            ```bash copy
            REACT_APP_GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_DEV_API_KEY"
            REACT_APP_GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab value="Other">
            Many react frameworks each have a unique way of exporting environment variables to the client.
            In development environments, both `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` need to be exported to the client.

            We have added support for a few libraries so far,
            but please let us know if your framework is not listed by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries/issues/new).
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    React environment variables are often bundled into your application at build time and are publicly visible in the client-side code.
    For security reasons, you should:
    
    - Only use development API keys during local development
    - Only use production API keys with the CLI tool for deployment
    - **Never include any API keys as environment variables in production**
</Callout>

## Let's try it out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start by changing your preferred browser's language settings. This will
    change which language is displayed. 
    * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424) 
    * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
    * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)
    {/* TODO: safari */}
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your React app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). *If you want to switch
    languages, just select a different language in your browser settings and
    refresh the page.*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading languages in development, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app is being translated in real time.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    
    This **only happens in dev** so you can easily prototype your website in different languages.
    All translations are preloaded in production, so there will be no delay.
    Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/next/tutorials/quickdeploy).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the setup tool automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that will automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, please follow [this guide](/docs/react/tutorials/translating-strings) for translating strings.
  </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Shipping to Production

Follow our guide on [shipping to production](/docs/react/tutorials/quickdeploy).

## Next steps
 * See our [React API reference](/docs/react/api/components/t) for detailed information about the `<T>` component and other available components.
 * Mirror your app to support [right-to-left languages](/docs/react/guides/rtl) such as Arabic and Hebrew.
 * Create a list of approved languages for your app with the [React plugin](/docs/react/guides/locale-management#include-locales).
