## Setup

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react) and [gt-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react-cli) libraries.


<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react
  npm i gt-react-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react
  yarn add gt-react-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-react
  bun add -d gt-react-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-react
  pnpm add -D gt-react-cli
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Run our CLI tool

Run the [gt-react-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-react-cli) tool to setup your project for translation.

This will scan your codebase for translatable content and automatically wrap it in `<T>` components.

```bash title="shell" copy
npx gt-react-cli setup
```

See the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/react/reference/cli#setup) for more information.

<Callout type="warn">
    **Experimental**

    This feature is currently experimental and may not work perfectly. 
    If you run into any issues, please let us know by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries/issues).
    In particular, note that some manual edits may be required.
</Callout>


<Callout>
    **Example**

    The CLI tool will wrap any JSX elements containing translatable content in `<T>` components.
    Each component will be given a unique `id` prop.

See the [`<T>` component documentation](/docs/usage/t) for more information.

```js title="app/page.js" copy
import { T } from "gt-react"; // [!code highlight]
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from "@components/ui/Card";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T id="app.page.0"> // [!code highlight]
      {/* This text will be translated */}
      <b>Shakespeare&apos;s</b> quotes
      {/* Any arbitrary components and their children will also be translated */}
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>Hamlet</CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <p>&quot;To be, or not to be: that is the question...&quot;</p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```
</Callout>


### 3. Set up your local environment

Add your API key and Project ID to your local environment.

<Steps>

    <Step>
        Navigate to your [GT Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
            * Navigate to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
            {/* TODO: Staging/testing envs */}
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Add the Project ID and API Key to your environment variables.
            ```bash copy
            GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
            GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    All React environment variables are bundled into your application at build time and are publicly visible in the client-side code. For security reasons, you should:
    
    - Only use development API keys during local development
    - Never include production API keys in your environment variables
    - Use production API keys only with the CLI tool for deployment
</Callout>

### 4. Add `<GTProvider>`

[`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider) is used to configure the behavior of `gt-react`. 
It should be placed as high up in your app as possible, ideally at the root.

To work out of the box, `<GTProvider>` needs the `projectID` you created earlier.


```jsx copy
import MyApp from "./MyApp";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider
      projectID="abc-123"
    >
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout>
In development, you should also pass your Development API key to the `devApiKey` prop.

<Tabs items={["vite", "webpack", "create-react-app"]}>
  <Tab value="vite">
  ```jsx copy
  <GTProvider
    projectID="abc-123"
    devApiKey={process.env.VITE_GT_DEV_API_KEY}
  >
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="webpack">
  ```jsx copy
  <GTProvider
    projectID="abc-123"
    devApiKey={process.env.GT_DEV_API_KEY}
  >
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="create-react-app">
  ```jsx copy
  <GTProvider
    projectID="abc-123"
    devApiKey={process.env.REACT_APP_GT_DEV_API_KEY}
  >
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


Make sure to remove this environment variable when shipping to production!
</Callout>

For a full list of `<GTProvider>` props and extended documentation, see the [API reference](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).

## Let's Try It Out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start by changing your preferred browser's language settings. This will
    change which language is displayed. 
    * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424) 
    * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
    * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)
    {/* TODO: safari */}
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your React app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). *If you want to switch
    languages, just select a different language in your browser settings and
    refresh the page.*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
        **Browser Cookies**

        Check your browser's cookies for your app.
        General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
        The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
        Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
        refresh the page.

        How to check cookies:
        * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
        * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
        * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
        * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
        **On-Demand Translation**

        You may notice when loading new languages, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
        This happens because your app has never been translated into that language before.
        We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
        All on-demand translations get cached in production environments,
        so a delay will only occur the first time a new language is requested.

        Luckily, this can be avoided by translating your app ahead of time for production deployments.
        Doing so does not increase bundle size and significantly reduces load times.
        See our instructions for how to [translate ahead of time](quickstart#cli-tool).
    </Accordion>

## Shipping to Production

### CLI Tool [#cli-tool]

In order to ship your app to production, you will need to run our CLI tool to parse your codebase and validate your content.

<Callout type="info">
    **Security**

    Due to the nature of client-sided rendering in React,
    you must pre-authorize your content with the CLI tool before it can be translated.
    This means that you must run the CLI tool before deploying to your production environment.

</Callout>

Run the following command in your deployment process:

```bash copy
npx gt-react-cli translate
```

The CLI tool expects a production API key and project ID. There are a few ways to set these:

- Set the `GT_API_KEY` and `GT_PROJECT_ID` environment variables in your deployment environment.
- Pass the `--api-key` and `--project-id` flags to the CLI tool.

For more information, see the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/react/reference/cli-tool#usage).

<Callout type="warn">
    **For Production Only!**

    This CLI tool is meant to *only be used for production deployments*.
    Make sure you have the correct API key and project ID in your environment variables,
    and make sure that you are translating the same content that is being used for production
    (i.e., the branch you are on when you run this command is the branch used for production).

</Callout>
