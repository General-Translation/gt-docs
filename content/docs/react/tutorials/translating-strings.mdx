## Overview

This guide is a step by step tutorial on how to translate strings in your React app
using General Translation using [translation dictionaries](/docs/react/reference/dictionaries/dictionaries).

We will also discuss how to add variables to your strings.

  **Coming up:**
  We are currently working on a new feature that will expedite the process of translating strings.
  For now, please use the dictionary pattern for string translation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

We assume that you already have installed `gt-react` in your project and have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart).

### Steps

<Steps>
  <Step>
  **Create a dictionary file**

 This file will store all of the string content that you want to translate.

  ```jsx title="src/dictionary.jsx" copy
    const dictionary = {
      id: 'here is a string' // [!code highlight] 
    }
    export default dictionary;
  ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **Pass the dictionary to the `<GTProvider>`**

    ```js copy
    <GTProvider dictionary={dictionary}>
      ...
    </GTProvider>
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
  **Reference the string in your component**

  Now that you have centralized all of the content you want to translate,
  you can reference the string in your component with the [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/dictionary/useGT) hook.

  ```jsx title="src/components/MyComponent.jsx" copy
  import { useGT } from 'gt-react';
  export default function MyComponent() {
    const { t } = useGT();
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{t('id')}</h1> // [!code highlight]
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

You have now internationalized your strings!
Try [loading your app in a different language](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart#see-your-app-in-a-different-language) and watch the magic happen.

## Adding Variables

You can add variables to your strings through a pattern very similar to string formatting.

Inside of your dictionary file, add an identifier where you want to insert the variable.

```jsx title="src/dictionary.jsx" copy
// [!code word:{identifier}]
const dictionary = {
  id: ' here is a string with a variable: {identifier} '
}
export default dictionary;
```

Then, in your component, pass the variable as a second argument to the `t()` function.

```jsx title="src/components/MyComponent.jsx" copy
// [!code word:identifier]
import { useGT } from 'gt-react/client';
export default function MyComponent() {
  const { t } = useGT();
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{t('id', { identifier : 'variable content' })}</h1> // [!code highlight]
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Notes
 * In order to use the dictionary pattern, you must add the [`initGT()` plugin](/docs/react/api/config/withGTConfig).
 * Reference the string content using [`useGT()`](/docs/react/api/dictionary/useGT) for client components and [`getGT()`](/docs/react/api/dictionary/getGT) for server components.

## Next Steps
 * Dictionaries also work with JSX content. For more information, see the [Dictionaries Reference](/docs/react/reference/dictionaries/dictionaries).
