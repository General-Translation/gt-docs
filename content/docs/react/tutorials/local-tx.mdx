title: Local Translations
description: Setup local translations for your React app
---

## Overview

This guide will show you how to serve translations directly for your React app.
This means that translations will live in your app bundle and be served directly from your app.
This can lead to faster loader times and avoids reliance on external infrastructure.

In this document, we will (1) explain what are local translations and how they work and
(2) show you how to set up local translations for your React app.

## What are local translations?

Local translations are stored in your app's codebase and served in the bundle.

Let's say that you have added the `gt-react-cli translate` command to your CD process.
This will generate JSON files containing translations for your app.
The final step is to get these translations out of our API and into your app.

There are two ways to do this:
 * **Build Time:** After translations are generated, add them to your app's bundle.
 * **Runtime Time (default):** Fetch from translations from a CDN (Content Distribution Network) at runtime.

### What are the benefits?

*Faster load times:* Local translations are served directly from your app,
meaning that they will load faster than translations served from a CDN.

*No reliance on external services:* Your apps ability to load translations is not dependent on the availability of a CDN.

### What are the drawbacks?

*Increased bundle size:* Local translations will increase your app's bundle size as they will be served alongside your app.
This means that your app may take slightly longer on first load.

*Locale management:* In order to add or remove support for locales, you will need to redeploy your app each time.

*Content management:* Much like locale management, if you want to change a translation (i.e., you do not like how your content has been phrased in a different language),
you must redeploy your app with the new translation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart) to set up your react app with GT.


### Steps
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add a `loadTranslation.js` file under `./src` with the following content:

    ```js title="src/loadTranslation.js" copy
    export default async function loadTranslation(locale) {
      const t = await import(`./_gt/${locale}.json`);
      return t.default;
    }
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step>
    Pass `loadTranslation` as a prop to the `<GTProvider>` component.

    ```jsx title="src/App.jsx" copy
    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
    import loadTranslation from './loadTranslation'; // [!code highlight]

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <GTProvider loadTranslation={loadTranslation}> // [!code highlight]
          <YourApp />
        </GTProvider>
      );
    }
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the flags `--no-publish` and `--translations-dir` to the `translate` command to enable local translations.

    ```bash
    npx gt-react-cli translate --no-publish --translations-dir ./src/_gt
    ```

    <Callout>
      Depending on the specific framework you are using, you may need to ensure that the translation JSONs are included in the
      final bundle.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Your app will now only load translations from your local files.

## Notes:
 * Local translations are an alternative to fetching translations from a CDN.
 * You can customize `loadTranslation()` to also load translations from other sources, such as your database or your own CDN.

## Next Steps:
 * See the `loadTranslation` function in the [API Reference](/docs/react/api/config/load-translation) for more information.
