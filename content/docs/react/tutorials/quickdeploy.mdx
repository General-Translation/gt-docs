title: Deploying to Production (5m)
description: Let's deploy your react app with GT.

## Overview

This is a short tutorial to help you deploy your react app with GT.

We will do this in 3 steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add your production API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the translate command to your build script.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Share your configuration with your app.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart) to set up your react app with GT.

## Step 1: Switch to your production API keys üîë

Add your **production** API key and Project ID to your production environment variables.

From your [dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/signin), go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
Click on **Create API Key**, and add them to your production envrionment.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
    Likewise, development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

## Step 2: Add the translate command to your build script üèóÔ∏è

The next step is to add the translate command to your build script.
Make sure that the translate command comes before the build command.

Specify the [locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) that you would like to ship to production.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gt-react-cli translate --locales fr zh && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```
Here, we have added French and Chinese to our configuration.


<Callout>
  **Tip:** Because we have specified the locales in the build script, they have been recorded in the config file.
  You can edit the languages you want to support via the config file.
  Just remember to remove any hard coded languages from [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).
</Callout>

## Step 3: Share your configuration with your app ‚öôÔ∏è

Pass the config file to [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";
import config from "../gt.config.json";  // [!code highlight]

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider {...config}> // [!code highlight]
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider> 
  );
}
```

That's it! You are now ready to deploy your react app with GT!
