title: Deploying to Production (5m)
description: Let's deploy your react app with GT.

## Overview

This is a short tutorial to help you deploy your react app with GT.

We will do this in 3 steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add your production API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Share your configuration with your app.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the translate command to your build script.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart) to set up your react app with GT.

## Step 1: Switch to your production API keys üîë

Add your **production** API key and Project ID to your production environment variables.

From your [dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/signin), go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
Click on **Create API Key**, and add them to your production envrionment.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
    Likewise, development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

## Step 2: Share your configuration with your app ‚öôÔ∏è

The translate command will generate a configuration file in the root.

Pass the config file to [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/react/api/components/gtprovider).
If you have specified any locales in your provider, remove them.
The configuration file will take care of that.

```jsx title="src/App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from "gt-react";
import MyApp from "./MyApp";
import config from "../gt.config.json";  // [!code highlight]

export default function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider {...config}> // [!code highlight]
      <MyApp />
    </GTProvider> 
  );
}
```

## Step 3: Add the translate command to your build script üèóÔ∏è

The last step is to add the [translate command](/docs/cli/translate) to your build script.
Make sure that the translate command comes before the build command.

Specify the [locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) that you would like to ship to production.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gtx-cli translate --locales fr zh && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```
Here, we have added French and Chinese to our configuration.

That's it! You are now ready to deploy your react app with GT!
