## Overview

This document provides guidance on how to manage locales in your Next.js application with the `gt-next`.

This library uses the [BCP-47 standard](/docs/reference/locale-strings) to define locales.
See a list of currently supported locales [here](/docs/reference/supported-locales).

## Managing Locales

There are three ways to manage locales:
 1. Through the dashboard
 2. Locally using the `gt.config.json` file
 3. Locally using the CLI tool

In order for translation to be performed, you must add the translate command to your build script:

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gt-react-cli translate && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

This will generate the necessary translations and store them in the cloud or in your local filesystem depending on your configuration.

### Managing locales through your dashboard

Navigate to your [project dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
Click on **Manage Locales** in the sidebar.

From there you can add and remove locales from your project.
If your project uses the General Translation CDN to serve translations (default behavior),
this will automatically update your production application to only include the configured locales.

You must omit the `locales` property from your `gt.config.json` file to use this feature.

### Managing locales locally

You also have the ability to add new locales using the `gt.config.js` file as well.
Just specify the list of locales you want to support in the `locales` property.

```json title="gt.config.json" copy
{
  "locales": ["en-US", "zh", "jp"],
}
```

Remember to pass the config file to your GTProvider component.

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
import config from './gt.config.json';

function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider {...config}>
      <YourApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    **Note:** When you specify locales in your `gt.config.json` file, you cannot use the **Manage Locales** feature in the dashboard.
    In order to change your supported locales, you must update your `gt.config.json` file and redeploy.
</Callout>


### Managing locales with the CLI tool

You can also add the list of locales to your `npx gt-react-cli translate` command by using the `--locales` flag.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gt-react-cli translate --locales en-US zh jp && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```

This will behave just like adding the `locales` property in the `gt.config.json` file.
Also make sure that you pass the config file to your GTProvider component.

```jsx title="App.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-react';
import config from './gt.config.json';

function App() {
  return (
    <GTProvider {...config}>
      <YourApp />
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
```


## Whitelisted locales

As an optional feature, you can add a list of whitelisted locales.
If you enable this feature, any attempts to call npx translate on a non-whitelisted locale will fail.

## Notes
 * You can manage locales through the dashboard, the `gt.config.json` file, or the CLI tool.
 * Using `gt.config.json` or CLI tool to manage locales will disable the **Manage Locales** feature in the dashboard.

 ## Next Steps
 * Learn about the locale syntax in the [Locale Strings](/docs/reference/locale-strings) reference.
