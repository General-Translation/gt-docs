Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com). 

We publish developer libraries for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) apps which automate your entire internationalization ("i18n") stack.

- Setup is simple, with no need for complex rewrites of your project.
- Translations ship in seconds and load in milliseconds.
- UI gets translated in context by powerful AI models.

## Get started

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'React']}>
    <Tab value="Next.js">
    Follow the [Quickstart](/gt-next/quickstart) guide to ship your first translations.

    **npm**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-next
    ```
    **yarn**
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-next
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="React">
    Follow the [Quickstart](/gt-react/quickstart) guide to ship your first translations. 
    
    **npm**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-react
    ```
    **yarn**
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-react
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why choose General Translation?

**General Translation creates the entire i18n stack**, from developer libraries, to AI translations, to the infrastructure that serves your translations.
Because we built the whole stack from scratch, it:

#### Translates entire React components, not just strings

UI passed as the children of the `<T>` component will be translated, regardless of how complicated the JSX tree:

```javascript
import { T } from 'gt-next'
import CustomButton from './CustomButton'

export default function Page() {

    const myFunction = () => { console.log("myValue") };

    return (
        <T id="my_id">
            <p>
                You can write any JSX as children of the {"<T>"} component.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, you could write a <a href='/'>link</a> and have the text be translated in context.
            </p>
            <CustomButton onClick={myFunction}>
                Or you could translate the children of a complex component like this one!
            </CustomButton>
        </T>
    )
}
```

#### Supports translated content inline or in dictionaries

JSX content placed inside a `<T>` component is marked for translation:

<Tabs items={['page.js']}>
    <Tab value="page.js">  
        ```jsx copy
        // inline translation

        import { T } from 'gt-next;

        // translates <p>Hello, world</p>
        export default function Page() {
            return (
                <T id='hello'>
                    <p>Hello, world!</p>
                </T>
            )
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Many projects have a central dictionary in which they store all translatable content.
Uniquely, General Translation libraries let you write dictionaries as objects containing JSX:

<Tabs items={['page.js', 'dictionary.js', 'next.config.js']}>
    <Tab value="page.js">  
        ```jsx copy
        // dictionary translation

        import { getGT } from 'gt-next;

        // translates <p>Hello, world</p>
        export default function Page() {
            const t = getGT();
            return t('hello');
        }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="dictionary.js">  
        ```jsx copy
        const dictionary = {
            "hello": <p>Hello, world</p>
        }

        export default dictionary;
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="next.config.js">  
        ```jsx copy
        import { initGT } from 'gt-next/config'

        const nextConfig = {};

        // initialize the GT plugin
        const withGT = initGT(); 

        // bundles your JSX dictionary into your app
        export default withGT(nextConfig);
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Works across both client and server components

With first class support for the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

```jsx copy
// server component

import getName from '@/getName';
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next;

export default async function Page() {

    const name = await getName();

    return (
        <T id='greeting'>
            Hello, <Var value={name} />
        </T>
    )
}
```

```jsx copy
'use client'

// client component
// should be used inside <GTProvider>

import { useState } from 'react';
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next;

export default function Page() {

    const [name, setName] = useState("Alice");

    return (
        <T id='greeting'>
            Hello, <Var value={name} />
        </T>
    )
}
```

#### Supports on-demand translation

(Experimental, currently `gt-next` server components only.)

Sometimes, your app needs a translation which doesn't already exist.

This can happen if:
- You've enabled the language a user requests, but never created translations for it before.
- You've changed some translated content in your project without requesting a new translation for it.

In this situation, `gt-next` can create a translation for you on demand, during runtime. This translation will be streamed via your server to your user within a few seconds.

<Callout>
**What this looks like:** the rest of the page loads, with your translated component loading in a few seconds later. The second time a user visits your page, the new translation will be cached, so it should load like any other component.
</Callout>

Most projects should use the [CLI tool](/gt-next/cli) to create translations in advance, rather than relying on on-demand translations.
