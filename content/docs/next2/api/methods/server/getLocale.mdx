title: getLocale()
description: API Reference for the getLocale server-side method
---

## Overview

The `getLocale()` function retrieves the user's current locale during server-side rendering.
This method is essential for server-side locale management, such as determining the active language for rendering or routing.

The returned locale is [formatted as a string](/docs/reference/locale-strings), e.g., `'en-US'`.

<Callout>
    `getLocale()` is a server-side method and cannot be used in client components. For client-side locale management, see [`useLocale()`](/docs/next2/api/methods/client/useLocale).
</Callout>

### When to Use

- Use `getLocale()` in server-side logic, such as API routes, middleware, or server components.
- Dynamically fetch the user's locale for server-side rendering or computation.

## Reference

### Returns

A promise that resolves to a string representing the user's current locale, e.g., `'en-US'`.

## Example

### Basic Usage

Retrieve the user's locale during server-side rendering.

```javascript title="src/server/getUserLocale.js" copy
import getLocale from 'gt-next/server'; // [!code highlight]

export default async function getUserLocale() {
    const locale = await getLocale(); // Retrieve the user's locale // [!code highlight]
    console.log(locale); // Example: 'en-US'

    return locale;
}
```

## Notes
 * The `getLocale()` function is asynchronous and must be awaited to retrieve the locale.
 * It is specifically designed for server-side use. See [`useLocale()`](/docs/next2/api/methods/client/useLocale) for client-side components.
 * The returned locale adheres to the [Locale Strings](/docs/reference/locale-strings) format.

## Next Steps
 * Learn how to configure supported locales with [i18n Configuration](/docs/next2/reference/i18n-configuration).
 * For managing fallback locales, see [`getDefaultLocale()`](/docs/next2/api/methods/server/getDefaultLocale).
