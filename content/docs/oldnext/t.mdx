description: Using the <T> tag to translate your components
---

`<T>` is the translation tag in `gt-next`. Children of `<T>` will be translated into your [configured](/docs/oldnext/advanced/config) languages.

<Callout>
    To create translations, run the [CLI tool](/docs/oldnext/cli) before you build your app.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
    If it is being used in a client component, `<T>` must be able to access the context from a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/oldnext/gt-provider).
</Callout>

It requires two props:
- `id`, which is a unique string representing the content 
- `children`, which is the content to translate

For example, the following code would translate the content `"Hello, world"` with the id `"greeting"`.

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-next'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            Hello, world
        <T>
    )
}
```

The above would display `"Hello, world"` in the English version of the app, and `"Hola mundo"` in the Spanish version.

The `<T>` component can also contain JSX, like:

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-next'
import CustomButton from './CustomButton'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <T id="jsx">
            <div>
                <p>Hello, world!</p>
                <CustomButton>This is a complex button!</CustomButton>
            </div>
        <T>
    )
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
    Text must be passed directly as a child of `<T>` to be translated.
</Callout>

`<T>` uses our cloud services to create and cache translations. If a translation is unavailable, `<T>` will default to displaying the content in your default locale ([`defaultLocale`](/docs/oldnext/advanced/config#defaultlocale)), usually English.

### On-demand translation

Testing `<T>` in server components is easy, just [change your browser language](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424) and reload the page. 
Translations will be created on-demand and load in within a few seconds.
