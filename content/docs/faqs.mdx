## Do I own my translations?

**Yes.** 

> You, the customer, retain full ownership and rights to any translated output produced through the Services. We make no claim to your output.

## What are tokens?

When text is sent to [GT](https://www.generaltranslation.com) APIs, it is broken down into chunks called *tokens*.
Think of tokens as small pieces of your input text, like words or parts of words, that an AI model uses to understand and translate your content.

> A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This translates to roughly ¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words).

For example, the string `Hello, world!` has 13 characters, and 4 tokens: `Hello`, `,`, ` world`, and `!`.

If you go over the token limit for your plan, we begin to charge based on token usage. 
We only ever charge based on the length of your input — never the length of the translation.
Read more about our available plans [here](https://www.generaltranslation.com/plans).

For example, imagine you have the string `"Hello, world!"`, and your project's languages are `"fr"` (French), `"es"` (Spanish), and "`de"` (German).
Token usage will be calculated as `4 * 3 = 12`. That is, the 4 tokens of `"Hello, world!"`, translated 3 times.

We currently tokenize with OpenAI's `tiktoken`, which is the same tokenizer used by [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/). You can explore this tokenizer [here](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).
