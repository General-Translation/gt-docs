## Usage

Use this command to initialize your project's GT settings. It should be run once when you are first internationalizing your project.

```bash
npx gtx-cli init
```

## Overview

The `init` command helps you configure your project's GT settings.

It will create a `gt.config.json` file in the root of your project.

The file will contain the following settings:

- `defaultLocale`: The default locale for your project.
- `locales`: An array of supported locales for your project.
- `translationsDir`: The directory containing your project's language files. This setting is only used if you are not using a remote CDN.
