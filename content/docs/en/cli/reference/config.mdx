## Overview

The `gt.config.json` file is used to configure your project's GT settings. It should be placed in the root of your project.

The CLI command `npx gtx-cli init` will create a `gt.config.json` file for you in your project.

## Configuration

The `gt.config.json` file contains the following settings:

- `defaultLocale`: The default locale for your project. This is the locale that your source content is written in. This is also the fallback locale for your project (if using `gt-next` or `gt-react`).

- `locales`: An array of locales for your project. These are the locales that you want to translate your project into. See the [supported locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) for more information. 
If you are using `gt-next` or `gt-react`, these are also the locales that your app supports.

- `files`: This is an object that contains information about the content you want to translate.


Here is an example of the `gt.config.json` file:

```json title="gt.config.json"
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["fr", "es"],
  "files": {
    "gt": {
      "output": "..."
    },
    "json": {
      "include": [...]
    },
    "mdx": {
      "include": [...]
    },
    "md": {
      "include": [...]
    }
  }
}
```

`files` should contain a key for each file type that you want to translate.
You can configure your project to mix and match different file types, and have them all be translated.
We currently support the following file keys:

- `gt`: General Translation files.
- `json`: JSON files.
- `mdx`: Markdown component files.
- `md`: Markdown files.

## `gt`

This key is used for General Translation files, specifically for saving translations locally. If you are using the GT CDN, this key is not needed.

The corresponding object should contain an `output` key. The value should be a string containing a `[locale]` placeholder indicating the locaiton where the translations will be saved.

For example, if you want to save Spanish translations to a file called `ui.es.json`, you should use the following string:

```json title="gt.config.json"
"files": {
  "gt": {
    "output": "content/docs/ui.[locale].json"
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">

This option should only be used if you are using `gt-next` or `gt-react`, and want to save translations locally, instead of using the GT CDN.

Currently, only one file for each locale can be generated.

</Callout>

## `json`

The corresponding object should contain an `include` key. The value of the `include` key is an array of glob patterns that match the files you want to translate.

You should use the `[locale]` placeholder in your glob patterns to ensure that the correct locale is used.
The CLI tool will replace the `[locale]` placeholder with the `defaultLocale` value when searching for translatable files.

It will save translated files to the corresponding path, with the `[locale]` placeholder replaced with the locale code.

Optionally, you can also include an `exclude` key. The value of the `exclude` key should be an array of glob patterns that match the files you want to exclude from translation.

Here, we've included an example of the `json` object:

```json title="gt.config.json"
"files": {
  "json": {
    "include": ["json_files/[locale]/**/*.json"],
    "exclude": ["json_files/[locale]/exclude/*.json"]
  }
}
```

Let's say your project's default locale is `en`, and you want to translate your project into `fr` and `es`.

With this configuration, the CLI will search for all JSON files under the subdirectory `json_files/en/` and save the translated files to `json_files/fr/` and `json_files/es/`.

It will ignore any files in the subdirectory `json_files/en/exclude/`.

## `mdx`

The configuration for `mdx` files is almost identical to the `json` configuration.

Just replace the `json` key with `mdx` and update the glob patterns to match your MDX files.

For example, if you want to translate all MDX files in the `content/docs/en` directory into Japanese, you should use the following configuration:

```json title="gt.config.json"
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["ja"],
  "files": {
    "mdx": {
      "include": ["content/docs/[locale]/**/*.mdx"]
    }
  }
}
```

This will save the translated files to the `content/docs/[locale]` directory.

---

## `md`

The configuration for `md` files is almost identical to the `mdx` configuration.

Just replace the `mdx` key with `md` and update the glob patterns to match your MD files.
