## Overview

The `gt.config.json` file is used to configure your project's GT settings. It should be placed in the root of your project.

The CLI command `npx gtx-cli init` will create a `gt.config.json` file for you in your project.

## Configuration

The `gt.config.json` file contains the following settings:

- `defaultLocale`: The default locale for your project. This is the locale that your source content is written in. This is also the fallback locale for your project (if using `gt-next` or `gt-react`).

- `locales`: An array of locales for your project. These are the locales that you want to translate your project into. See the [supported locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) for more information. 
If you are using `gt-next` or `gt-react`, these are also the locales that your app supports.

- `files`: This is an object that contains information about the content you want to translate.
Here is an example of the `files` object:

```json title="gt.config.json"
"files": {
  "json": {
    "include": ["path/to/include/[locale].json"],
    "exclude": ["path/to/exclude/[locale].json"]
  }
}
```

`files` should contain a key for each file type that you want to translate.
We currently support the following file keys:

- `gt`: General Translation files.
- `json`: JSON files.

## `json`

The corresponding object should contain an `include` key. The value of the `include` key is an array of glob patterns that match the files you want to translate.

You should use the `[locale]` placeholder in your glob patterns to ensure that the correct locale is used.
The CLI tool will replace the `[locale]` placeholder with the `defaultLocale` value when searching for translateable files.

It will save translated files to the corresponding path, with the `[locale]` placeholder replaced with the locale code.

Optionally, you can also include an `exclude` key. The value of the `exclude` key should be an array of glob patterns that match the files you want to exclude from translation.

## `gt`

The corresponding object should contain an `output` key. The value should be a glob pattern that matches the files you want to save the translations to.

The `[locale]` placeholder in your glob patterns is required to ensure that the correct locale is used.

For example, if you want to save the translations to a file called `ui.es.json`, you should use the following glob pattern:

```json title="gt.config.json"
"files": {
  "gt": {
    "output": "content/docs/ui.[locale].json"
  }
}
```


<Callout type="info">

This option should only be used if you are using `gt-next` or `gt-react`, and want to save translations locally, instead of using the GT CDN.

Currently, only one file for each locale can be generated.

Here is an example of the `gt.config.json` file:

```json title="gt.config.json"
{
  "defaultLocale": "en",
  "locales": ["fr", "es"],
  "files": {
    "json": {
      "include": ["path/to/include/[locale].json"],
      "exclude": ["path/to/exclude/[locale].json"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, the CLI will search for the JSON file at `path/to/include/en.json` and save the translated files to `path/to/include/fr.json` and `path/to/your/es.json`.

It will ignore any files that match the glob pattern `path/to/exclude/[locale].json`.
