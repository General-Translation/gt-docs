description: How to deploy your project to production with General Translation
---

# Overview

This is a guide on how to use the [General Translation CLI tool](/docs/reference/cli) to deploy your site to production.
This CLI tool scans through your project and looks for content to translate. It handles both the dictionary and the `<T>` component formats.



Read more about the CLI tool [here](/docs/reference/cli).

This guide assumes that you have already integrated `gt-next` or `gt-react` into your project.
If you haven't, please follow the [NextJS Quick Start Guide](/docs/next/tutorials/quickstart) or the [React Quick Start Guide](/docs/react/tutorials/quickstart) before proceeding.

<Callout type="error">
    **For production only!**

    Because this CLI tool publishes translated content to the CDN, it is meant to only be used for production builds, and should not be used in development.
    Before running this command, please make sure you are on the branch that will be used for production.
    Remember to also use your production API key and Project ID.
</Callout>

## Usage

### Basic usage

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Add your API key and Project ID to your environment variables.
        You can do this by adding the following to your `.env` file or directly to your environment:

        ```.env copy
        GT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        GT_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Install the CLI tool:

        <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
          <Tab value="npm">
          ```bash 
          npm i gt-react-cli
          ``` 
          </Tab>
          <Tab value="yarn">
          ```bash 
          yarn add gt-react-cli
          ```
          </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Next, run the following command:

        ```bash title="shell" copy
        npx gt-cli translate
        ```

        By default, running the command above will enable on-demand translation for all supported locales.
    </Step>
</Steps>


Translations are usually ready within a minute, but could take up to five minutes in periods of high demand. When translations are ready you
should be able to access them via the cache in both your local and production projects.

### Pre-Translation

By default, your project will be translated on-demand depending on the locales of the users who visit your site. Since these
on-demand translations may take a few seconds to complete, you can pre-translate your project to serve cached translations to your users.

You can select which locales you want to pre-translate by specifying them in the command.

```bash copy
npx gt-cli translate --locales fr es ja
```

<Callout>
For more information on specifying locales, read our article about locale strings [here](/docs/reference/locale-strings).

</Callout>

If the script is successful, you should see a similar message to the following:

```shell
âœ“ Success! {number} tokens received and ready for translation at runtime.
To translate your app in advance, rerun with the --locales flag. For example: `npx gt-cli translate --locales fr`
```


### Dry run

To test a dry run of the CLI tool, you can use the `--dry-run` flag. Running the CLI tool with this flag allows
you to validate proper usage of the `<T>` components or dictionary formats in your codebase, without actually sending data to our servers.

```bash copy
npx gt-cli translate --dry-run
```
