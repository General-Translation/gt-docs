description: How to use General Translation with 3rd party i18n libraries
---

## Overview

General Translation also includes a CLI tool which can be used to translate projects using 3rd party i18n libraries.

The CLI tool is able to parse the JSON files used by most 3rd party i18n libraries, and translate them.

Currently, we support translating projects using the following 3rd party libraries:

- [`next-intl`](https://next-intl.dev/)
- [`i18next`](https://i18next.com/) (including `react-i18next` and `next-i18next`)
