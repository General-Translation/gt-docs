# Overview

As an alternative to the [`<T>`](/docs/usage/t) component, dictionaries are a way to translate content in General Translation. 
Contrary to to the `<T>` component, dictionaries store all translations in a single file, in a key-value format.


There are a few advantages to using dictionaries over the `<T>` component:

1. **Performance**: The dictionary is faster than the `<T>` component because it doesn't have to parse the content at runtime.
3. **Historical Precedent**: The dictionary is a common design pattern in the industry and is used by many other libraries.

At the same time, it has some disadvantages as well:

1. **Complexity**: The template dictionary is more complex to set up than the `<T>` component.
2. **Readability and Maintainability**: The template dictionary is less readable and maintainable than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline.
3. **Ease of Use**: The template dictionary is less intuitive to use than using the `<T>` component inline as a React component.

Both design patterns are supported by our library and are not mutually exclusive.
You can use a dictionary alongside `<T>` components.

Here is an example of a dictionary:

```jsx title="src/dictionary.js" copy
const dictionary = {
    greetings: {
        hello: <>Hello, World!</>, // JSX content
        goodbye: 'Goodbye, World!'  // string content
    },
} 
export default dictionary;
```
