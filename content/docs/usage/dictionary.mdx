# Overview

As an alternative to the [`<T>`](/docs/usage/t) component, dictionaries are a way to translate content in General Translation. 
Contrary to to the `<T>` component, dictionaries store all translations in a single file, in a key-value format.


There are a few advantages to using dictionaries over the `<T>` component:

1. **Centralized Storage**: Dictionaries store all translatable content in a single file, making it easier to manage and update.
2. **Historical Precedent**: The dictionary pattern is a common design pattern in the industry and is used by many other libraries.

At the same time, it has some disadvantages as well:

1. **Complexity**: Dictionaries are more complex to set up and use than the `<T>` component.
2. **Readability**: Dictionaries are less readable than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline.

Both design patterns are supported by our library and are not mutually exclusive.
You can use a dictionary alongside `<T>` components.

Here is an example of a dictionary:

```jsx title="src/dictionary.jsx" copy
const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    hello: <>Hello, World!</>, // JSX content
    goodbye: 'Goodbye, World!'  // string content
  },
} 
export default dictionary;
```
Here's how you would use the dictionary in a component:

<Tabs items={["Client Component"]}>
  <Tab value="client-component">
  ```jsx copy
"use client";
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';

export default function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = useGT(); // on the client side, you use the useGT hook

  return (
    <GTProvider>
      <div>
        {t('greetings.hello')}
      </div>
    </GTProvider>
  );
}
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
