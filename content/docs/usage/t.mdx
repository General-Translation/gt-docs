# Overview

The `<T>` component is the primary way to translate content in General Translation. It can be used alongside dictionaries, or standalone.

The `<T>` component can be used to translate text, HTML, and React components in-line.


### Our Advice

We recommend using the `<T>` component because of its simplicity especially if you are new to internationalization (i18n).
We offer dictionaries for those who prefer this design pattern from past experiences or ease of integration with existing code bases.

We go into the reasons and justifications for this recommendation in [this article](/docs/next/discussions/inline-vs-dictionary).
