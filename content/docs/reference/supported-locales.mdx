description: List of currently supported languages for translation

## Overview

This page lists the languages currently supported by General Translation (GT) for translation services.

Our system leverages some of the most advanced LLM models on the market to provide accurate translations;
however, these models are not without their limitations.
Certain resource languages may not be supported by the model provider you have selected or any of the available providers.
These languages are known as "low-resource languages".

Low-resource languages can vary between models, so if you specify a preferred model provider in your configuration, you may want to check the list of supported languages for that provider.
