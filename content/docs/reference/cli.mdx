## Overview

This is a reference doc on the General Translation CLI tool.
For a step by step guide, check out the [Deploying to Production](/docs/usage/cli-tool) guide.

### Installation

  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-react-cli
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-react-cli
  ```
  </Tab>

## What does the CLI tool do?

The CLI tool is a script that will scan your entire app for content to be translated.
During this scan, it will parse and validate any `<T>` components or dictionaries that are used in your codebase.

After parsing and validating content, the CLI tool will save the corresponding hashes and content on our servers.
If eager translation is specified, the GT API will pre-translate the content in the specified locales and cache it on our CDN.

## What is eager translation? [#pre-translation]

Eager translation is the process of translating content in advance.
This way, when the user requests a page, the translated content is already available in the CDN and can be served immediately.

Of course, it is not always the best practice to translate every single language in advance.
You should consider the languages that are most commonly used by your audience and translate those.
The rest can be translated at runtime as necessary.


## Is this required?

Yes, you must run the CLI tool as part of your CI/CD pipeline in order to ensure that your content is able to be translated in production.

Due to the nature of React (and Next.js client components) being rendered on the client side, API Keys and similar credentials
cannot be passed to the client. The CLI tool is necessary to prevent abuse from malicious actors. 

Running the CLI tool allows GT to pre-authorize your content for translation via hashing, eliminating security vulnerabilities.


## Reference

To use the CLI tool, run the following command from the root of your project:

```bash title="shell" copy
npx gt-cli translate
```

<Callout type="warn">
    **For Production Only!**

    Because this CLI tool publishes translated content to the CDN, it is meant to only be used for production builds and **should not be used in development**.
    Before running this command, please make sure you are on the branch that will be used for production.
    Remember to also use your production API key and Project ID.
</Callout>

        default: 'false',
    },
    "--inline": {
        description:
            'Include inline <T> tags in addition to the dictionary',
        type: 'boolean',
        optional: true,
        default: 'true',
    },
  }}
/>

When running the CLI tool for the first time, it will attempt to create a `gt.config.json` file in the root of your project.
This file contains insensitive project data that is used to translate your content.
