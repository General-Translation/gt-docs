## Overview

This is a reference doc on the General Translation CLI tool.
For a step by step guide, check out the [CLI Tool guide](/docs/guides/cli-tool).


## What is Pre-Translation? [#pre-translation]

Pre-translation is a process where you send your content to be translated before the user requests it.
This way, when the user requests a page, the translated content is already available in the CDN and can be served immediately.

Of course, it is not always the best practice to pre-translate every single language.
You should consider the languages that are most commonly used by your audience and pre-translate those.
The rest can be translated on demand.

The CLI tool is a script that will scan your entire app for content to be translated.
It will then send this content to the General Translation API.
Following translation, the translated content will be distributed to the CDN which will be ready for users to request when needed.

## When Should You Pre-translate?

<Callout type="warn">
    **For Production Only!**

    Because this CLI tool publishes translated content to the CDN, it is meant to only be used for production builds, and should not be used in development.
    Before running this command, please make sure you are on the branch that will be used for production.
    Remember to also use your production API key and Project ID.
</Callout>

You can easily integrate the CLI tool with your CI/CD pipeline or run it manually in your terminal.

## How to Pre-translate

It is as simple as running:

```bash copy
npx i18n
```

This will scan through your project and generate translations for the default languages.
Of course, you can specify which locales you want to pre-translate.
