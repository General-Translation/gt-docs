## Overview

General Translation uses a variant of the [BCP 47 Language Tag standard](https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php) to represent locales and languages.
BCP 47 Language Tags are the Internet Best Current Practices (BCP) standard for identifying languages in both spoken and written forms.
These tags provide a uniform way to specify languages, allowing applications to adapt content, format, and behavior based on the user's locale.

Language tags are composed of one or more subtags separated by the `"-"` character. The subtags include the following components:

- **Language Subtag**: Represents the primary language, e.g., `en` for English, `es` for Spanish.
- **Region Subtag**: Specifies a country or region, e.g., `US` for the United States, `FR` for France.
- **Script Subtag** (optional): Indicates the writing script, e.g., `Latn` for Latin script.
- **Variant Subtag** (optional): Identifies a specific variation of a language, e.g., `arevela` for Eastern Armenian.

### Commonly Used Tags

In practice, most language tags consist of two subtags: a language and a region. Here are some common examples:

| Language Tag | Description                |
|--------------|----------------------------|
| `en-US`      | English as used in the US  |
| `es-ES`      | Spanish as used in Spain   |
| `fr-CA`      | French as used in Canada   |
| `zh-CN`      | Simplified Chinese (China) |
| `de-DE`      | German as used in Germany  |

### Extended Tags

Language tags can include additional subtags for more specificity:

- **Example**: `hy-Latn-IT-arevela`
  - `hy`: Armenian (language)
  - `Latn`: Latin (script)
  - `IT`: Italy (region)
  - `arevela`: Eastern Armenian (variant)

This tag represents Eastern Armenian written in Latin script, as used in Italy.

## Exceptions to BCP 47 in GT

## Notes
 * The format of BCP 47 language tags makes them highly flexible and extensible.
 * Applications should prioritize using the language and region subtags for simplicity, while including script and variant subtags only when necessary.
 * When designing localized content or systems, understanding and leveraging BCP 47 tags ensures broad compatibility and clarity.

## Next Steps
 * See our [List of Supported Locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) to find the language tags available in General Translation.
 * For more information about BCP 47 standards, refer to the official [IETF Language Tag Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry).
