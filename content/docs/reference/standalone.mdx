## Overview

All of our libraries are open source and free to use. They work fully standalone, out of the box.

You can use them in any project, without needing to ever create an account or sign up for General Translation services.

Out of the box, our libraries support the following features:

- Wrapping entire React components for translation
- Dictionaries
- Easy project setup
- Middleware

You will just need to manually provide source JSONs for each locale.

Signing into our platform and creating an account is optional, but will unlock the following features:

- On-demand translation
- Automatic AI translations
- No-hassle translation CDN

## How to use
