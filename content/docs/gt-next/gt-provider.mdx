<Callout type="warn">
    **In Next.js, you should use `<GTProvider>` in a server component**
</Callout>

**In the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), components are server components by default.**
This means they are executed on the server, and can perform server-specific actions like `async` API calls and accessing environment variables.

Components which use client-side JavaScript, including React hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()`, are client components. They must marked with [`'use client'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#using-client-components-in-nextjs) or the descendants of another client component.
   
To use translations in client components, you must pass them from the server to the client using `<GTProvider>`. `<GTProvider>` uses React's [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) API to give its descendants access to translations and locale information.

## Inline translations

`<T>` components which are the children of a `<GTProvider>` **must** have an `id` prop, or they will throw an error.

## Hooks

The following hooks are available to the children of `<GTProvider>`:

- [`getLocale()`](/docs/gt-next/helpers#getlocale): Retrieves the user's current language as an [ISO-639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) language code.
- [`getDefaultLocale()`](/docs/gt-next/helpers#getdefaultlocale): Retrieves the application's default language as an ISO-639 language code.
- [`getGT()`](/docs/gt-next/dictionaries): Used to initialize the `t()` function, which loads a translation from the dictionary, if you are using a dictionary pattern.

## Using `<GTProvider>` with `id`

If your app is very large and you don't want to provide all of your translations in the server response, pass the optional `id` prop to `<GTProvider>`. 
This will let you send a nested subset of your server-side dictionary to the client. 
Every `<T>` component which is a child of `<GTProvider>` must have an `id` prefixed with the `id` you pass to `<GTProvider>`.

### Example

```javascript copy
// page.js

import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next'
import MyClientComponent from './MyClientComponent'

export default function Page() {
    // using GTProvider with the 'id' prop to pass only a subset of the dictionary to the client
    return (
        <main>
            <GTProvider id='client'>
                <MyClientComponent />
            </GTProvider>
        </main>
    )
}

```

```javascript copy
'use client'

import { useState } from 'react'
import { T, Num } from 'gt-next'

export default function MyClientComponent() {

    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        <T id='client.my_id'>
            <div>
                The count is <Num value={count} />!
            </div>
            <div>
            <button onClick={() => {setCount(prev => prev + 1)}}>
                Click me
            </button>
            </div>
        </T>
    )
}
```

## Using `<GTProvider>` on the client side

It's better to use `<GTProvider>` in a file not marked `'use client'`, so that it can fetch translations on the server-side. 
If you really need to put `<GTProvider>` on the client, import `<GTProvider>` from `'gt-next/client'` (not recommended in server-first apps), and follow the [`gt-react`](/docs/gt-react/quickstart#add-gtprovider) documentation.
