title: i18n Routing
description: Using `gt-next`'s built-in middleware to create i18n routes for your app
---

i18n routing is a web development technique used to manage multiple languages and regional formats on a website, ensuring users can access content in their preferred language through language-specific URLs. It involves detecting the user's language and providing localized routes, like `www.example.com/fr` for French. `gt-next`'s middleware allows you to easily add i18n routing to your Next.js App Router project.

In Next.js, create a file called `middleware.js` (or `.ts` if you are using TypeScript) inside the root directory. If you are using the `src/` folder, place it in `src/middleware.js` instead.

```js copy
// middleware.js

import { createNextMiddleware } from 'gt-next/middleware'

export default createNextMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
      /*
       * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
       * - api (API routes)
       * - _next (internal files)
       * - static files
       */
      "/((?!api|static|.*\\..*|_next).*)",
  ],
}
```

You should include `defaultLocale` and `locales` in both `middleware.js` and [`next.config.js`](/docs/next/config). The reason you have to include them separately is that on certain hosts (e.g. Vercel), middleware runs in a different environment, meaning `createNextMiddleware()` does not have access to your `initGT()` configuration.

```js copy
// middleware.js

import { createNextMiddleware } from 'gt-next/middleware'

export default createNextMiddleware({
  defaultLocale: "en-US",
  locales: ["en-US", "fr", "es", "de", "ja"]
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [
      /*
       * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
       * - api (API routes)
       * - _next (internal files)
       * - static files
       */
      "/((?!api|static|.*\\..*|_next).*)",
  ],
}
```

Then, create a dynamic route (e.g., `[lang]`) in your app folder, and include all pages and layouts under it. From [Vercel](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization#routing-overview):

> Ensure all special files inside `app/` are nested under `app/[lang]`. This enables the Next.js router to dynamically handle different locales in the route, and forward the lang parameter to every layout and page. 

Your file structure should look like:

```
my-app/
├── middleware.js
├── app/
│   ├── [lang]/
│   │   ├── layout.js
│   │   ├── page.js
│   │   └── some-page/
│   │       └── page.js
│   └── api/
│       └── route.js
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       └── logo.png
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
└── next.config.js
```

This will enable `gt-next`-powered i18n routing on your Next.js project.
