title: Manage Locales
description: How to manage and specify supported locales in your application
---


## Overview

Managing locales is a critical step when building a multilingual application with `gt-next`.
This guide will walk you through how to define, configure, manage supported locales.
By default, your app can be translated into all available languages.

In this guide, we will cover how to manage locales in your application, including:
 * Select Supported Locales
 * (Coming Soon) Select Excluded Locales


## Including Locales [#include-locales]

Including specific locales for translation ensures that only the languages you have specified will be translated.
For instance, if you have selected English, Chinese, and Japanese as your supported locales, translations will only be performed for these languages.
Any other languages not included in your list of locales will not be translated.

This approach helps to manage resources effectively and ensures that translations are only provided for the locales that are relevant to your application.

These instructions assume that you have already integrated `gt-next` into your Next.js application and you have added your API keys to your environment.

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Locate your config file, typically `your-app/next.config.mjs` (or `.ts`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the `locales` property to your `initGT` configuration object.
        This property should be an array of strings, each representing a locale.
        For example, to prioritize English, Chinese, and Japanese, you would write:
```js title="next.config.js" copy
import { initGT } from 'gt-next/config'

const withGT = initGT({
  defaultLocale: "en-US",
  locales: ["en-US", "zh", "jp"]
});

export default withGT({});
```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **(Optional)**
        If you are using the `gt-next` middleware in your application, you must also specify the supported locales in the `createNextMiddleware` function.
```js title="middleware.js" copy
import { createNextMiddleware } from 'gt-next/middleware'

export default createNextMiddleware({
  locales: ["en-US", "zh", "jp"]
});

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    "/((?!api|static|.*\\..*|_next).*)",
  ],
}
```

        See [I18n Routing](/docs/guides/i18n-routing) for more information on how to set up the middleware.
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Pitfalls

### Supported Locales

General Translations utilizes LLM models generate accurate translations.
However, these models are not without their limitations.
Certain resource languages may not be supported by the model provider you have selected or any of the available providers.
To see a list of supported languages, you can refer to the [List of Supported Locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales).
