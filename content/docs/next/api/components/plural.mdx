description: API Reference for the <Plural> component

## Overview

We use the `<Plural>` component for handling "pluralization" and "number agreement".
It is like a specialized version of the [`<Branch>` component](/docs/next/api/components/branch).

The `<Plural>` component evaluates the value of `n` and determines which branch of content to display.
For translations, it will generate new branches based on the plural forms of the locale automatically.
If no matching plural branch is found, it falls back to rendering the `children` content.

As always, private and dynamic information should be wrapped in a variable component.

## Reference

### Props

<TypeTable
  type={{
    "n": {
        description:
            'The number used to determine the plural form. This is required for pluralization.',
        type: 'number',
        optional: false,
    },
    "children?": {
        description:
            'Fallback content to render if no matching plural branch is found.',
        type: 'any',
        optional: true,
        default: 'undefined',
    },
    "locales?": {
        description:
            'Optional locales to specify the formatting locale. If not provided, the default application locale is used.',
        type: 'string[]',
        optional: true,
        default: 'undefined',
    },
    "[key]: string": {
        description:
            'Branches representing plural forms. The exact branches depend on the locale.',
        type: 'string | JSX.Element',
        optional: false,
    },
  }}
/>




The exact plural forms depend on the locale and follow [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).

The `[key]: string` indicates dynamic keys representing potential branches.
This means the keys can be any string, but they should match the plural forms you want to handle.
This is used because the plural forms depend on the locale and are not fixed.
For example, Apps being developed in English would use two plural forms: `one` and `other`.
Apps being developed in Chinese would only use one: `other`.

### Returns

`JSX.Element` containing the content corresponding to the plural form of `n`, or the fallback content.

### Throws

`Error` if `n` is not provided or is not a valid number.

## Example

### Basic Usage

The `<Plural>` component dynamically handles singular and plural forms.


```jsx title="PluralExample.jsx" copy
import { T, Plural, Num } from 'gt-next'; // [!code highlight]

export default function ItemCount({ count }) {
    return (
        <T id="item_count">
            <Plural
                n={count}
                one={You have <Num>{count}</Num> item.}
                other={You have <Num>{count}</Num> items.}
            />
        </T>
    );
}
```

### Fallback Content

If no matching branch is found, the `<Plural>` component renders the `children` fallback content.
This example has identical functionality as the above snippet.

```jsx title="FallbackExample.jsx" copy
import { T, Plural } from 'gt-next'; // [!code highlight]

export default function ItemCount({ count }) {
    return (
        <T id="item_count">
            <Plural
                n={count}
                one={You have <Num>{count}</Num> item.}
            >
                You have <Num>{count}</Num> items. // [!code highlight]
            </Plural>
        </T>
    );
}
```


## Notes
 * The available plural branches (e.g., one, other, few, many) depend on the locale and follow [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules).
 * For more advanced usage, combine `<Plural>` with other components like `<Num>` for formatted numbers.
