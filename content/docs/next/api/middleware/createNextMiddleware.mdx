## Overview
`createNextMiddleware()` is a utility function that creates a middleware function for use with Next.js.
It allows you to add a different route for each locale in your Next.js application.

For example, a french user would be directed to `/fr/landing` and an english user would be directed to `/en/landing`.

For more information on how to use this middleware, see the [i18n routing guide](/docs/next/reference/i18n-routing).
