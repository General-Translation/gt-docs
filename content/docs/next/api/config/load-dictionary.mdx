title: loadDictionary()
description: API Reference for the loadDictionary() function.
---

## Overview

`loadDictionary()` is used to add custom translations to your app for i18n.
This is most useful for those who already have translations and want to manually manage them.
Follow this guide on setting up [custom translation files](/docs/next/reference/custom-translations) for more information.

If multiple translations exist, translations from dictionaries loaded by `loadDictionary()` will always take precedence over others.
`loadDictionary()` only supports the use of JSON files with string translations.


## Reference

### Parameters
<TypeTable
  type={{
    "locale": {
        type: 'string',
        optional: false,
    },
  }}
/>

### Description
| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `locale` | The locale for which translations should be loaded. |

### Returns

A `Promise<any>` that resolves to dictionary mapping ids to translations for the given locale.

---

## Usage

Generally, you will load the dictionary from the `./public/locales` directory.

```jsx title="src/loadDictionary.js"
export default async function loadDictionary(locale) {
  const translations = await import(`../public/locales/${locale}.json`);
  return translations.default;
}
```

  **Question:** What's the difference between [`loadTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations) and [`loadDictionary()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-dictionary)?

  * [`loadTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations) is used to define custom loading behavior for fetching translations for your app.
  This could be getting translations from a CDN, a database, or your app's bundle.
  These are usually machine generated translations, managed by the cli tool, and not very user friendly to edit.
  * [`loadDictionary()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-dictionary) is used for loading translation files with custom translations.
  These files are usually hand-written translations, are more user-friendly to edit, and managed by the developer or translators.
  Dictionary files will take precedence over translations loaded with `loadTranslations()`.

## Notes
 * `loadDictionary()` is used to load custom translations for your app.
 * Dictionaries loaded by `loadDictionary()` will take precedence over translations loaded by [`loadTranslations()`](/docs/next/api/config/load-translations).
