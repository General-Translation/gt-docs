description: Conditional behavior with branching components in dictionary entries
---

## Overview

Branching components in `gt-next` enable dynamic, conditional rendering of translations based on specific criteria or values.
When combined with [dictionaries](/docs/next/reference/dictionaries/dictionaries),
these components provide a powerful way to handle content variations and localization logic directly in your dictionary entries.

Branching components include:
 * [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch): Dynamically renders a specific branch of content based on a branch value.
 * [`<Plural>`](/docs/next/api/components/plural): Handles pluralization rules based on a numerical value (`n`).

 <Callout>
    Branching components are processed locally, ensuring that all logic and conditional rendering happens on the client or server without requiring additional translation API calls.

## Why Use Branching Components with Dictionaries?

By using branching components in dictionaries, you can:
 * Implement conditional logic directly in your dictionary entries.
 * Simplify the management of localized content variations.
 * Automatically adapt translations to complex scenarios such as pluralization or application states.

This approach eliminates the need for external conditional logic, consolidating both content and logic into the dictionary itself.

## Adding Branching Components to Dictionaries

Branching components can be included in dictionary entries to manage variations in content dynamically.

### Example: Adding Branches to a Dictionary

Below is an example of how you can use `<Branch>` and `<Plural>` components in a dictionary.

```jsx title="src/dictionary.js" copy
import { Branch, Plural, Num } from 'gt-next';

const dictionary = {
  messages: {
    // Conditional rendering with <Branch>
    userStatus: (
      <Branch
        name="status-branch"
        active={<p>The user is currently active.</p>}
        inactive={<p>The user is currently inactive.</p>}
        banned={<p>The user is banned.</p>}
      >
        <p>Status unknown.</p>
      </Branch>
    ),
    // Handling pluralization with <Plural>
    notifications: (
      <Plural
        name="notification-plural"
        one={<>You have <Num name="notificationCount" /> new notification.</>}
        other={<>You have <Num name="notificationCount" /> new notifications.</>}
      />
    ),
  },
};

export default dictionary;
```

## Accessing Branches

When accessing dictionary entries that use branching components, you must pass the relevant dynamic data (e.g., `branch` value or `n`)
through the options parameter. This can be thought of keys that map to a value that will be rendered.

### Example: Client-Side Usage with `useGT()`

```jsx title="src/components/UserStatus.js" copy
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';

export default function UserStatus({ status }) {
  const t = useGT();

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Passes the `status` as a branch value */}
      {t('messages.userStatus', { "status-branch": status })}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Example: Server-Side Usage with `getGT()`

```jsx title="src/pages/Notifications.js" copy
import { getGT } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const t = await getGT();

  const notificationCount = 5; // Example dynamic data
  res.send(
    // Passes `n` and `notificationCount` for pluralization
    t('messages.notifications', { "notification-plural": notificationCount, "notificationCount": notificationCount })
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

### Define Clear Branch Keys

When using `<Branch>`, define clear and meaningful branch keys that align with your application's state or logic.

```jsx copy
// Good Example
<Branch active={<>Active</>} inactive={<>Inactive</>} banned={<>Banned</>} />

// Bad Example
<Branch a="Active" i="Inactive" b="Banned" />
```

### Include a Fallback

Always include a fallback value in `<Branch>` and `<Plural>` components to ensure graceful handling of unexpected conditions or values.

## Common Pitfalls

### Missing Dynamic Values

If dynamic values (e.g., branch or n) are not provided, the Branching Component may not render the expected content.
Always ensure that the necessary options are passed when accessing dictionary entries.

### Overloading Dictionary Entries

Avoid combining too much logic or complexity into a single dictionary entry.
Break down entries into smaller, manageable components to maintain clarity and flexibility.

## Notes
 * Branching Components handle conditional logic locally, ensuring efficient and secure translations.
 * Combine Branching Components with [Variable Components](/docs/next/reference/dictionaries/variable-components) for more complex scenarios involving dynamic content.
 * The `<Plural>` component follows [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules) for accurate localization.

## Next Steps
 * Explore the API Reference for [`Branching Components`](/docs/next/api/components/branch).
 * Learn about [Unicode CLDR pluralization rules](https://cldr.unicode.org/index/cldr-spec/plural-rules) rules for pluralization support.
 * Review the [Template Dictionary Design Pattern](/docs/next/reference/dictionaries/dictionaries) for creating scalable and maintainable translations.
