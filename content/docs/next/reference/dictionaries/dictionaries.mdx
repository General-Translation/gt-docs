## Overview

In this reference guide, we will introduce you to the dictionary pattern.
We will explain what a dictionary is and how to use it in your Next.js application.

## What is a dictionary?

General Translation allows translatable content to be stored in a dictionary file.
A dictionary is a nested object where keys can either be strings or JSX elements.
This dictionary file is then used to generate a translation dictionary at build time or run time (depending on your implementation).

Dictionaries can be used standalone, or in conjunction with `<T>` components.

## Dictionaries vs Inline

The dictionary pattern has a few advantages over the `<T>` component:

1. **Centralized Storage**: Dictionaries store all translatable content in a single file, making it easier to manage and update.
2. **Historical Precedent**: The dictionary pattern is a common design pattern in the industry and is used by many other libraries.

At the same time, it has some disadvantages as well:

1. **Complexity**: Dictionaries are more complex to set up and use than the `<T>` component.
2. **Readability**: Dictionaries are less readable than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline.

Both design patterns are supported by our library and are not mutually exclusive.
You can use a dictionary along side `<T>` components.

### Our advice

We recommend using the `<T>` component because of its simplicity especially if you are new to internationalization (i18n).
We offer dictionary support for those who prefer this design pattern from past experiences or for ease of integration with existing code bases.

We go into the reasons and justifications for this recommendation in [this article](/docs/next/discussions/inline-vs-dictionary).


## How to use dictionaries

In this section, we will show you how to set up a bare-bones dictionary implementation in your Next.js application.
We will walk through the following steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Create a dictionary
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Use the dictionary
    </Step>
</Steps>

on setting up a NextJS project with a dictionary.

### Step 1: Create a dictionary

The first step is to create a dictionary.
This is a `dictionary.jsx` (or `.tsx`) file that contains all the content you want to translate. 
Create the dictionary at the same level as your `app/` directory.

```
my-app/
├── middleware.js
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── [locale]/
│   │   │   ├── layout.js
│   │   │   ├── page.js
│   │   │   └── some-page/
│   │   │       └── page.js
│   │   └── api/
│   │       └── route.js
│   └── dictionary.jsx       <-- Dictionary
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       └── logo.png
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
└── next.config.js
```

If you are not using a `src/` folder, you can also specify the directory of the dictionary in the [`next.config.js`](/docs/next/api/methods/config/initGT) file.
If you are using i18n routing, make sure to also specify the directory of the dictionary in the [`middleware.js`](/docs/next/guides/i18n-routing) file.

Add the following content to your `dictionary.[jsx|tsx]` file:

```js title="src/dictionary.[jsx|tsx]" copy

const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    hello: <>Hello, World!</>, // JSX content
    goodbye: 'Goodbye, World!'  // string content
  },
}

export default dictionary;
```


### Step 2: Use the dictionary

There are a few ways to use the dictionary, depending on the context where you are trying to use the dictionary.
For example, if you are in a client-side component, use the [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/client/useGT)
hook and for server-side components use [`await getGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/server/getGT).

Here is an example of how to use the dictionary in a client-side component:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';

export default function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = useGT(); // on the client side, you use the useGT hook

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

And here is an example of how to access the translations in a server-side component:

```jsx
import { getGT } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = await getGT(); // on the server side, you have to await a promise

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```


### `useElement()`

The [`useElement()`](/docs/next/api/methods/useElement) allows you to access the translations in a React element.
It works on both client and server side components, so it offers an alternative to [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/client/useGT) and [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/server/getGT).

As its name suggests, **it only works with React elements**.
String values in the dictionary are **not supported**.

```jsx
import { useElement } from 'gt-next';

export default function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = useElement();

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Prefixes

Additionally, with `useGT()`, `getGT()`, and `useElement()`, you can pass in a prefix to the function to specify a shared path in the dictionary.
This is useful if you have a shared path in your dictionary that you want to use in multiple components.

```jsx
import { getGT } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function MyComponent() {
  // All translation paths such as 'hello' will be prefixed with 'greetings'
  const { t } = await getGT('greetings'); // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <div>
      {t('hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Paths are period separated, so you can specify multiple prefixes.

```jsx
const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    common: {
      hello: <>Hello, World!</>, // JSX content
    },
  },
}
export default async function MyComponent() {
  // All translation paths such as 'hello' will be prefixed with 'greetings'
  const { t } = await getGT('greetings.common'); // [!code highlight]

  return (
    <div>
      {t('hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```
Similarly, you can specify multiple prefixes when retrieving an element.

```jsx
export default async function MyComponent() {
  // All translation paths such as 'hello' will be prefixed with 'greetings'
  const { t } = await getGT('greetings'); 

  return (
    <div>
      {t('common.hello')} // [!code highlight]
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Notes

- Dictionaries are an alternative to the `<T>` component.
- They can be used in conjunction with `<T>` components or standalone.
