description: A step by step guide on adding internationalization (i18n) routing to your application
---

## Overview
This guide will walk you through adding i18n routing to your Next.js application using `gt-next`'s built-in middleware.

## What is i18n Routing?

Creating new routes for each language has the advantage of making your website more SEO-friendly and statistics aggregation easier.
i18n routing allows you to associate specific URLs with different locales.
For example, you can have `www.example.com/en/landing` for English, `www.example.com/fr/landing` for French, and so on.


## Guide

We will take you through two easy steps to add i18n routing to your Next.js application:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Add a dynamic route to your app folder.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Create the middleware file.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        (Optional) Specify supported locales.
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Step 1: Add a Dynamic Route [#dynamic-route]

Insert a directory in your app folder called `[locale]` (e.g., `app/[locale]`).
Include all of your pages and layouts under this directory.

```
my-app/
├── middleware.js
├── app/
│   ├── [locale]/     <-- Dynamic route
│   │   ├── layout.js
│   │   ├── page.js
│   │   └── some-page/
│   │       └── page.js
│   └── api/
│       └── route.js
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       └── logo.png
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
└── next.config.js
```

Ensure all special files inside `app/` are nested under `app/[locale]`.



### Step 2: Add the middleware file [#middleware]

In Next.js, create a file called `middleware.js` (or `.ts` if you are using TypeScript) inside the root directory.
If you are using the `src/` folder, place it in `src/middleware.js` (or `.ts`) instead.

```js title="middleware.js" copy
import { createNextMiddleware } from 'gt-next/middleware'

export default createNextMiddleware();

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    /*
      * Match all request paths except for the ones starting with:
      * - api (API routes)
      * - _next (internal files)
      * - static files
      */
    "/((?!api|static|.*\\..*|_next).*)",
  ],
}
```



### Step 3: Adding Supported Locales

Make sure to pass the locales you want the middleware to support to your configuration in `next.config.js`.

```js title="next.config.js" copy
import { withGTConfig } from 'gt-next/config'

const withGT = withGTConfig({
  defaultLocale: "en-US",
  locales: ["en-US", "fr", "es", "de", "ja"]
});

export default withGT({});
```

## Notes
 * i18n routing changes the URL structure of your application. Each language has its own URL.
 * The middleware file is required to handle the routing logic.
 * You can specify the supported locales in the middleware configuration and next config file.
