## What is the `<T>` Component?

The `<T>` component is the primary way to translate text and content in the `gt-next` library.
It allows for inline translation of text and JSX structures, providing a more direct way to manage translations in your application.
This is often times more convienient for the developer as it allows for more direct control over the translation content.

The `<T>` component supports static text, JSX structures, and context-aware translations.
When no translation is available, it gracefully falls back to displaying the content in the application's default locale.



## Design Patterns

In this section, we will detail common design patterns used with the `<T>` component.
This will also touch on that are tangentially related to the `<T>` component, but equally important, topics such as
string translation, pre-translating content, and privacy concerns.

### Wrapping your `<T>` components in a `<GTProvider>` [#gtprovider]

Generally, `<T>` is used to translate static text and JSX structures.
It is typically wrapped in a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider) context at a higher level, but this is not always necessary.
The `<T>` component relies on the `<GTProvider>` context to function in client-side components.
Our advice is to wrap your application in a `<GTProvider>` at the root level to provide this context.

```javascript copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <GTProvider>{children}</GTProvider>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```

#### Exceptions: Server-Side `<T>` Components [#server-t]

For server-side rendering, the `<GTProvider>` is optional for `<T>` components.

```javascript copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <T id="heading">
                    Hello, world!
                </T>
                <GTProvider>{children}</GTProvider>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```

### Variables in `<T>` Components

Variables can be used in `<T>` components to display dynamic content and/or private content.
These include [`<Var>`](/docs/next/api/components/var), [`<Num>`](/docs/next/api/components/num), [`<Currency>`](/docs/next/api/components/currency) and [`<DateTime>`](/docs/next/api/components/datetime) components.
For simplicity, we will use `<Var>` in this example.

The Variable Component is always wrapped inside of a `<T>` component.
The contents that we want to translate is then wrapped inside of the Variable Component.

```javascript copy
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next';

export default function DynamicGreeting({ user }) {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            Hello, <Var>{user.name}</Var>!
        </T>
    );
}
```

Depending on which component is used, you can specify more information about reformatting the variable content.
Read more about it in the [Variable Components](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components) article.

### Branching in `<T>` Components

Like variables, Branching Components can be used in `<T>` components to display different content based on conditions.
These include [`<Plural>`](/docs/next/api/components/plural) and [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch) components.
Let's examine the `<Branch>` component in this example.

The `<Branch>` component is always wrapped inside of a `<T>` component.
The contents that we want to translate is then wrapped inside of the `<Branch>` component.

```javascript copy
import { T, Branch } from 'gt-next';

export default function StatusMessage({ status }) {
    return (
        <T id="status">
            <Branch
                branch={status}
                active={<p>The user is active.</p>}
                inactive={<p>The user is inactive.</p>}
            >
                <p>Status unknown.</p>
            </Branch>
        </T>
    );
}
```

You can specify different options depending on which component you use.
Read more about it in the [Branching Components](/docs/next/reference/using-branching-components) article.

### Translating Strings [#translating-strings]

Right now, the best way to translate a string is to use the [Dictionary Design Pattern](/docs/next/reference/template-dictionaries/template-dictionaries).
This stands in contrast to the inline translation design pattern using the `<T>` component, but these two systems can be used in tandem, as we will see here.

To give a quick overview, you can define the string (or jsx) content in a dictionary file:
```jsx title="src/dictionary.js" copy
const dictionary = {
    greeting: "Hello, world!",
}
```

Then you can call it using the [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/client/useGT) hook or [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/methods/server/getGT) method for client and server-side components, respectively.

<Tabs items={['client', 'server']}>
    <Tab value="client">
    ```jsx title="src/components/TranslateGreeting.js" copy
    "use client";
    import { useGT } from 'gt-next';

    // This is a client-side component
    export default function TranslateGreeting() {
        const t = useGT();
        return <p>{t('greeting')}</p>;
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="server">
    ```jsx title="src/pages/api/translate-greeting.js" copy
    import { getGT } from 'gt-next';

    // This is a server-side component
    export default async function TranslateGreeting() {
        const t = await getGT();
        return <p>{t('greeting')}</p>;
    }
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout>
    We admit that this is not the most elegant solution.
    We are currently working on an easier way to translate strings in the future that will involve inline translation of strings.
</Callout>

### Pretranslating Common Languages

Pretranslating high frequency languages is a common practice to improve load times.
We have built a simple CLI tool that allows you to specify which languages you would like to pretranslate.
It can easily integrate with your CI/CD pipeline to ensure that translations are always up to date.

```bash
npx i18n --languages fr es ja
```

That's it! You have successfully pretranslated your application into French, Spanish, and Japanese.

For more information, please refer to the [CLI Tool](/docs/next/reference/cli) reference guide.

### Privacy Concerns

With some exceptions, all content wrapped in a `<T>` component is sent to the General Translation APIs for translation.
This might not be desirable for rendering sensitive data, such as user names, account numbers, etc.

To circumvent this issue, use [Variable Components](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components#privacy) to handle private information.
This ensures that no sensitive data is sent to the General Translation APIs for translation.
The localization of all content wrapped in any Variable Component is handled locally.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

The simplest use case for `<T>` is to translate static text.
Each `<T>` component requires a unique `id` to identify the content it translates.
This helps loadtime performance by fetching translations only when needed.

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-next';

export default function BasicUsage() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            Hello, world!
        </T>
    );
}
```

This example ensures that `"Hello, world!"` is translated based on the user's locale.
For example, in a Spanish locale, it may render as `"Â¡Hola, mundo!"`.


### Context

The `<T>` component supports additional context to refine translations.
Adding a context prop allows the same id to resolve to different translations depending on the context provided.
```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-next';

export default function FormalGreeting() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting" context="formal">
            Hi there!
        </T>
    );
}
```

For example, the context `"formal"` could yield a translation such as `"Good day, everyone!"`, while the same `id` without context might yield `"Hi there!"` in the other language.
Of course, no change would occur for the base language.

### Nested Components

The `<T>` component can also translate JSX structures.
Any children of the `<T>` will be translated.

```javascript copy
import { T } from 'gt-next';
import CustomButton from './CustomButton';

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <T id="jsx">
            This will be translated
            <div>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <CustomButton>This text will also be translated!</CustomButton>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </T>
    );
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

### Direct Text Only [#direct-text]

The `<T>` component only translates text passed directly as a child.
This means that if you have content inside a component that is not directly passed to `<T>`, it will not be translated.

Let's illustrate this with an example:

```javascript copy
function UntranslatedContent() {
    return (
        <p>This content is not translated</p>
    );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
            <UntranslatedContent />
        </T>
    );
}
```

In this example, the content inside `<UntranslatedContent>` will not be translated.
Only the content directly inside `<T>` will be translated, like the `<h1>` tag and its children.

This occurs because of how React renders components.
It is a bit complicated, but the gist is that React does not know the content of a component until it has rendered.
Therefore, the contents of components like `<UntranslatedContent>` are not translated.
However, any text directly `<T>` will be translated as expected.

#### What's the fix?

Your first instinct might be to add an additional `<T>` component inside `<UntranslatedContent>`, but this is not recommended.
We discuss this more [below](#nested-t).

The solution is to always wrap the text in the `<T>` component directly, like so:

```javascript copy
function TranslatedContent() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            <p>This content <b>IS</b> translated</p>
        </T>
    );
}

export default function DisplayGreetings() {
    return (
        <>
            <T id="greeting-title">
                <h1>Hello, this text will be translated</h1>
            </T>
            <TranslatedContent />
        </>
    );
}
```


#### What about variables? [#variables]

**TL;DR:** Variables will be translated, but please use [Variable Components](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components) or [Branching Components](/docs/next/reference/using-branching-components) for this purpose.

Variables are a little more complicated because they have the tendency to change their values.
The downstream effect is that a new translation will be generated each time the variable changes.
This can lead to performance issues.
To avoid this, we recommend using [Variable Components](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components) for displaying dynamic values and [Branching Components](/docs/next/reference/using-branching-components) for conditional logic.



### Nested `<T>` Components [#nested-t]

Nesting `<T>` components is not allowed.
Because of react's rendering system, this can lead to unexpected behavior and performance issues when translating on-demand.

Here is an example of **what not to do**:

```jsx copy
function SomeComponent() {
    return (
        <T id="other-nested-greeting">
            Hello, friend!
        </T>
    );
}

export default function NestedTranslation() {
    return (
        <T id="greeting">
            <T id="nested-greeting"> {/* Don't do this! */} // [!code highlight]
                Hello, world!
            </T>
            <SomeComponent /> {/* This still counts. Don't do this! */} // [!code highlight]
        </T>
    );
}
```
The solution here would be to remove the `<T>` component wrapping the nested `<T>` components.

### Conditional Content [#conditional-content]

Similar to [rendering variable content](#variables), conditional content within a `<T>` component needs to be handled properly.
It is always best practice to wrap the conditional content in a [Branching Component](/docs/next/reference/using-branching-components) to optimize the translation of content.

```jsx copy
import { T, Branch } from 'gt-next';

export default function Header({ user }) {
    return (
        <T id="header">
            <h2>
                <Branch
                    branch={user.hasAccount}
                    true={<p>Welcome back, {user.name}!</p>}
                    false={<p>Please log in to continue.</p>}
                />
            </h2>
        </T>
    );
}

```


### Dynamic `<T>` ids [#dynamic-ids]

Sometimes, you may want to use a dynamic string value for the `id` prop of a `<T>` component.
Don't do this.

This will trigger on-demand translation for every unique `id` value, which can lead to performance issues.
Always use a static string value for the `id` prop of a `<T>` component.

If you want to translate dynamic content, there are a few options available for you:

1. Use the [Branching Component](/docs/next/reference/using-branching-components) to conditionally render content.
    If you want to conditionally display content based on a value, use the [`<Branch>`](/docs/next/api/components/branch) component.
    This allows you to use pre-defined the content you want to be translated.

2. Use the [Variable Component](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components) to render dynamic content.
    If the content is dynamic (like displaying some integer, date, etc.), use a Variable Component to render the content.
    Furthermore, this can be combined with the Branching Component to conditionally render content if necessary.

3. If you want to render a string, please use the [Dictionary Design Pattern](/docs/next/reference/template-dictionaries/template-dictionaries).

You can read more about these design patterns in their respective reference guides or above in the [Design Patterns](#design-patterns) section.


## Notes
 * `<T>` components are used to translate arbitrary JSX Content.
 * Ensure every `<T>` component has a unique id for accurate translation tracking.
 * Wrap your app with a [`<GTProvider>`](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider) to enable translations in client components.

## Next Steps
 * Explore how to use variables in `<T>` translations in the [Variable Components article](/docs/next/reference/using-variable-components).
 * Discover how to manage pluralization and branching in the [Branching Components guide](/docs/next/references/using-branching-components).
