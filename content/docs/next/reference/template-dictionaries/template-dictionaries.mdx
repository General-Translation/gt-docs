## Overview

In this reference guide, we will introduce you to the Template Dictionary Design Pattern (TDDP).
We will explain what a Template Dictionary is and how to use it in your Next.js application.

## What is a Template Dictionary?

The Template Dictionary Design Pattern (TDDP) is, well, a design pattern for translating your app.
All translatable content is stored in a dictionary or a JSON file.
During build time or run time (depending on your implementation), our library will look at this dictionary and create an identical dictionary where we store translated content.

Every value in the dictionary to be translated is called a **Template**.
Hence, the original, untranslated dictionary is called the **Template Dictionary**.
For each template, a **Translation** is created.
These are stored in a mirror-image dictionary called the **Translation Dictionary**.

It is important to mention this is a *different design pattern from using [`<T>` components](/docs/next/reference/t-reference)*.
All content to be translated within the `<T>` component is written inline whereas the content to be translated in the TDDP is stored in the Template Dictionary.


## TDDP vs Inline

The template dictionary has a few advantages over the `<T>` component:

1. **Performance**: The template dictionary is can be than the `<T>` component because it doesn't have to parse the content at runtime.
2. **Flexibility**: Template dictionaries can contain either JSX or strings for translation whereas the `<T>` component can only translate React elements.
3. **Historical Precedent**: The template dictionary is a common design pattern in the industry and is used by many other libraries.

At the same time, it has some disadvantages as well:

1. **Complexity**: The template dictionary is more complex to set up than the `<T>` component.
2. **Readability**: The template dictionary is less readable than the `<T>` component because the content is not inline.

Both design patterns are supported by our library and are not mutually exclusive.
You can use a dictionary along side `<T>` components.

### Our Advice
We recommend using the `<T>` component because of its simplicity especially if you are new to internationalization (i18n).
We offer TDDP for those who prefer this design pattern from past experiences or ease of integration with existing code bases.

We go into the reasons and justifications for this recommendation in [this article](/docs/next/discussions/inline-vs-dictionary).


## How to Use TDDP

In this section, we will show you how to set up a bare-bones TDDP implementation in your Next.js application.
We will walk through the following steps:

on setting up a NextJS project with a Template Dictionary.

### Step 1: Create a Template Dictionary

The first step is to create a Template Dictionary.
This is a `dictionary.jsx` (or `.tsx`) file that contains all the content you want to translate.

```
my-app/
├── middleware.js
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── [locale]/
│   │   │   ├── layout.js
│   │   │   ├── page.js
│   │   │   └── some-page/
│   │   │       └── page.js
│   │   └── api/
│   │       └── route.js
│   └── dictionary.jsx       <-- Template Dictionary
├── public/
│   └── images/
│       └── logo.png
├── styles/
│   └── globals.css
└── next.config.js
```

If you are not using a `src/` folder, you can also specify the directory of the dictionary in the [`next.config.js`](/docs/next/api/methods/config/initGT) file.
If you are using i18n routing, make sure to also specify the directory of the dictionary in the [`middleware.js`](/docs/next/guides/i18n-routing) file.

Add the following content to your `dictionary.jsx` file:

```js title="src/dictionary.jsx" copy

const dictionary = {
  greetings: {
    hello: <>Hello, World!</>, // JSX content
    goodbye: 'Goodbye, World!'  // string content
  },
}

export default dictionary;
```


### Step 2: Access the Translation Dictionary

There are a few ways to access the translations in the Translation Dictionary, depending on the context where you are trying to access the translations.
For example, if you are in a client-side component, use the [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/useGT)
hook and for server-side components use [`await getGT()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/getGT) method.

Here is an example of how to access the translations in a client-side component:

```jsx
"use client";
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client';

export default function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = useGT(); // on the client side, you use the useGT hook

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

And here is an example of how to access the translations in a server-side component:

```jsx
"use server";
import { getGT } from 'gt-next/server';

export default async function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = await getGT(); // on the server side, you have to await a promise

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `useElement()`

The [`useElement()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/useElement) allows you to access the translations in a React element.
It works on both client and server side components, so it offers an alternative to [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/useGT) and [`getGT()`](/docs/next/api/dictionary/getGT).

As its name suggests, *it only works in React elements*.
String translation with this method is not supported.

```jsx
import { useElement } from 'gt-next';

export default function MyComponent() {

  const { t } = useElement();

  return (
    <div>
      {t('greetings.hello')}
    </div>
  );
}
```
