title: Next.js Quickstart
description: For the Next.js 13+ App Router
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that uses the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router) with `gt-next`.
We will cover four simple steps:
<Steps>
    <Step>
        Install the `gt-next` library
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Use the `<T>` component to translate your app
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Add the `<GTProvider>` component
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Update your env variables
    </Step>
</Steps>

{/* TODO: link to other guides */}

## Setup
### 1. Install gt-next

To install [gt-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next), navigate to your Next.js project's root directory and run: 

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab value="npm">
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-next
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="yarn">
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-next
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


### 2. Translate with the `<T>` Component

To translate your app, wrap the content you want to translate in a [`<T>` component](/docs/next/t).
Just remember, every `<T>` component should have a unique `id` prop.
<Callout>
    The text and structure of the tags inside your `<T>` component should be static.
    For dynamic content, use the [`<Var>` component](/docs/next/variables).
    {/* TODO:
        The text and structure of the tags inside your `<T>` component should be static.
        Translation of dynamic content is covered in in [this guide](/docs/next/dynamic-content).
     */}
</Callout>
```js title="app/page.js" copy
import { T } from 'gt-next'
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from '@components/ui/Card'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <T id='pages_quotes'>
            {/* You can translate your text */}  // [!code highlight]
            <b>Shakespeare&apos;s</b> quotes  // [!code highlight]

            { /* You can also translate any arbitrary components and their children */ }
            <Card>  // [!code highlight]
                <CardHeader>Hamlet</CardHeader>  // [!code highlight]
                <CardContent>  // [!code highlight]
                    <p>&quot;To be, or not to be: that is the question...&quot;</p>  // [!code highlight]
                </CardContent>  // [!code highlight]
            </Card>  // [!code highlight]
        </T>
    )
}
```


### 3. Wrap Your App with the `<GTProvider>` Component

To add translations to client `<T>` components, wrap your app in the [`<GTProvider>` component](/docs/next/gt-provider).

```javascript title="layout.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next'

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en">
            <body>
                <GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
                    { children }
                </GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
            </body>
        </html>
    )
}
```
<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="Should I update the <html> lang attribute?">

        Browsers read the `lang` attribute of the `<html>` tag to check the language of a site. 
        In Next.js, you can the `lang` attribute in your root `layout.js` file.

        While not required for your app to build, the correct application of the `lang` attribute is important for SEO, accessibility, and user experience.
        Therefore, we strongly recommend setting the `lang` attribute to the user's preferred language.

        ```js title="app/layout.js" copy
        import { getLocale, GTProvider } from 'gt-next'; // [!code highlight]

        export default async function RootLayout({ children }) {
            // Get the user's preferred language  // [!code highlight]
            const locale = await getLocale(); // [!code highlight]

            return (
                // Add the language to the DOM  // [!code highlight]
                <html lang={locale}> // [!code highlight]
                    <body>
                        <GTProvider>
                            { children }
                        </GTProvider>
                    </body>
                </html>
            );
        }
        ```
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>



### 4. Set up your local environment

Add your API key and Project ID to your local environment.

<Steps>

    <Step>
        Navigate to your [GT Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
            * Production Environments: Navigate to the **API Keys** page in the sidebar.
            * Development Environments: Navigate to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
            {/* TODO: Staging/testing envs */}
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key** or **Create API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Add the your Project ID and your API Key to your environment.
            ```bash title=".env.local" copy
            GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
            GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production API keys should only be used in production environments and **never** in non-production environments.
    Likewise, development API keys should **only** be used for local environments.

    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*

    {/* TODO: You can read more about configuring privacy here. */}
    {/* TODO: talk about information that is made public for production but not dev */}
    {/* TODO: talk about how dev is an auth cache (still under construction) */}
    {/* TODO: talk about how we will eventually have authenticated caches (can be used for personal info only avail to anyone who has the app or for alpha/beta testing) */}
</Callout>


## Let's Try It Out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language
<Steps>
    <Step>
        Start by changing your preferred browser's language settings. This will change which language is displayed.
            * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424)
            * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
            * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)
            {/* TODO: safari */}
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Start your Next.js app in development mode.
            <Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
                <Tab value="npm">
                ```bash copy
                npm run dev
                ```
                </Tab>
                <Tab value="yarn">
                ```bash copy
                yarn run dev
                ```
                </Tab>
            </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
        
        *If you want to switch languages, just select a different language in your browser settings and refresh the page.*
    </Step>
</Steps>
### Troubleshooting
<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
        **Browser Cookies**

        Check your browser's cookies for your app.
        General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
        The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
        Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
        refresh the page.

        How to check cookies:
        * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
        * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
        * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
        * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
        **On-Demand Translation**

        You may notice when loading new languages, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
        This happens because your app has never been translated into that language before.
        We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
        All on-demand translations get cached in production environments,
        so a delay will only occur the first time a new language is requested.

        Luckily, this can be avoided by translating your app ahead of time for production deployments.
        Doing so does not increase bundle size and significantly reduces load times.
        See our instructions for how to [translate ahead of time](quickstart#cli-tool).
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>


## Before Shipping to Production...

### Perform Translation Ahead of Time [#cli-tool]

In production, we **strongly** recommend translating your application ahead of time, rather than translating everything on demand.
This has major performance benefits for your application, and can easily be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.

Just run the following command in your project's root directory.
Make sure to use your production API key and project ID when you run this command.
```bash copy
npx i18n
```

For more information, see the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/next/cli).
<Callout type="warn">
    **For Production Only!**

    This CLI tool is meant to *only be used for production deployments*.
    Make sure you have the correct API key and project ID in your environment variables,
    and make sure that you are translating the same content that is being used for production
    (i.e., the branch you are on when you run this command is the branch used for production).
</Callout>

## Next steps

- Learn more about the [`<T>`](/docs/next) component, or dictionaries with [`useElement()`](/docs/next/dictionaries)
- Learn to improve SEO with [i18n routing](/docs/next/routing) (adding routes for each locale, e.g. `example.com/en`, `example.com/fr`)
- Mirror your app to support [right-to-left languages](/docs/next/advanced/rtl) such as Arabic and Hebrew.
- Create a list of approved languages for your app with the [Next.js plugin](/docs/next/config#install-the-plugin).
