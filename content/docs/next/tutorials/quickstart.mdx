title: Next.js Quickstart
description: Internationalize your Next.js App in 5 minutes with General Translation
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that uses the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router).

We will cover 4 simple steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Installing `gt-next` and `gt-next-cli`
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Setting up your local environment
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Adding `<GTProvider>` to your app
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Running the CLI tool to tag translatable content
    </Step>
</Steps>

This entire process should take under **5 minutes**.

## Setup

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next) and [gt-next-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next-cli) libraries.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-next
  npm i gt-next-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-next
  yarn add gt-react-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-next
  bun add gt-next-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-next
  pnpm add gt-next-cli --save-dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Add your development API keys

Add your API key and Project ID to your local environment.

<Steps>

    <Step>
        Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
        Go to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key**.
    </Step>

    <Step>
      Add the Project ID and Development API key to your environment.
      ```bash title=".env.local" copy
      GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
      GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
      ```
    </Step>
</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
    Likewise, production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

### 3. Add `<GTProvider>`

[`<GTProvider>`](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider) is used to configure the behavior of `gt-next` in client components. 
It should be placed in the [`layout.js`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages#creating-a-layout) file at the root of your app directory.

```jsx title="Layout.js" copy
import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next' // [!code highlight]
import { getLocale } from 'gt-next/server'

export default async function RootLayout() {

  // ensures the html lang attribute is correct
  const locale = await getLocale(); 

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <GTProvider>  // [!code highlight]
          {children}
        </GTProvider>  // [!code highlight]
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For a full list of `<GTProvider>` props and extended documentation, see the [API reference](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider).

### 4. Run the CLI tool

Use the [gt-next-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next-cli) to setup your project for translation.

```bash title="shell" copy
npx gt-next-cli setup
```

This will scan your codebase for translatable content and automatically wrap it in `<T>` components.
See the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/next/reference/cli#setup) for more information.

<Callout type="warn">
  **Experimental**

  We are currently experiencing issues with automated translations setup for string content.
  If you run into issues, please follow [this guide](/docs/next/tutorials/translating-strings) for translating strings.
</Callout>

## Let's Try It Out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language [#see-your-app-in-a-different-language]

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start by changing your preferred browser's language settings. This will
    change which language is displayed. 
    * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424) 
    * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
    * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)
    {/* TODO: safari */}
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your Next.js app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). *If you want to switch
    languages, just select a different language in your browser settings and
    refresh the page.*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
  <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
    **Browser Cookies**

    Check your browser's cookies for your app.
    General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
    The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
    Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
    refresh the page.

    How to check cookies:
    * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
    * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
    * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
    * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
    **On-Demand Translation**

    You may notice when loading new languages, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
    This happens because your app has never been translated into that language before.
    We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
    All on-demand translations get cached to improve load times,
    so a delay will only occur the first time a new language is requested.

    Luckily, this can be avoided by translating your app ahead of time for production deployments.
    Doing so does not increase bundle size and significantly reduces load times.
    See our instructions for how to [translate ahead of time](quickstart#cli-tool).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why are some things translating and others not?">
    **JSX Translation**

    Right now, the setup tool automatically adds `<T>` components around text content.
    We are currently working on a solution that will automatically setup string translations.
    Until then, if you are rendering a string, try using the [`tx()`](/docs/next/api/strings/tx) function for servers-side strings and [`useGT()`](/docs/next/api/dictoinary/useGT) for client-side strings.
