title: Next.js Quickstart
description: Internationalize your Next.js App in 5 minutes with General Translation
---

## Overview

This guide describes how to internationalize an existing [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project that uses the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router).

We will cover 4 simple steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Installing the required libraries
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Setting up your local environment
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Adding `<GTProvider>` to your app
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Running the CLI tool to tag translatable content
    </Step>
</Steps>

This entire process should take under **5 minutes**.

## Setup

### 1. Install libraries

Install the [gt-next](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next) and [gt-next-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next-cli) libraries.

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "bun", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab value="npm">
  ```bash 
  npm i gt-next
  npm i gt-next-cli --save-dev
  ``` 
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="yarn">
  ```bash 
  yarn add gt-next
  yarn add gt-react-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="bun">
  ```bash 
  bun add gt-next
  bun add gt-next-cli --dev
  ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="pnpm">
  ```bash 
  pnpm add gt-next
  pnpm add gt-next-cli --save-dev
  ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Set up your local environment

Add your API key and Project ID to your local environment.

<Steps>

    <Step>
        Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
            * For Production Environments: Navigate to the **API Keys** page in the sidebar.
            * For Development Environments: Navigate to the **Developer Keys** page in the sidebar.
            {/* TODO: Staging/testing envs */}
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Click **Create Dev API Key** or **Create API Key** then copy the API key and Project ID to your clipboard.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        Add the Project ID and API Key to your environment.
            ```bash title=".env.local" copy
            GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
            GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
            ```
    </Step>

</Steps>
<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production API keys should only be used in production environments and **never** in non-production environments.
    Likewise, development API keys should **only** be used for local environments.

    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*

    {/* TODO: You can read more about configuring privacy here. */}
    {/* TODO: talk about information that is made public for production but not dev */}
    {/* TODO: talk about how dev is an auth cache (still under construction) */}
    {/* TODO: talk about how we will eventually have authenticated caches (can be used for personal info only avail to anyone who has the app or for alpha/beta testing) */}

</Callout>

### 3. Add `<GTProvider>`

[`<GTProvider>`](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider) is used to configure the behavior of `gt-next` in client components. 
It should be placed in the [`layout.tsx`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/layouts-and-pages#creating-a-layout) file at the root of your app directory.

```jsx copy
// layout.js

import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next'
import { getLocale } from 'gt-next/server'

export default async function RootLayout() {

  // ensures the html lang attribute is correct
  const locale = await getLocale(); 

  return (
    <html lang={locale}>
      <body>
        <GTProvider>
          {children}
        </GTProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

For a full list of `<GTProvider>` props and extended documentation, see the [API reference](/docs/next/api/components/gtprovider).

### 4. Run our CLI tool

Run the [gt-next-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gt-next-cli) to setup your project for translation.

This will scan your codebase for translatable content and automatically wrap it in `<T>` components.

```bash title="shell" copy
npx gt-next-cli setup
```

See the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/next/reference/cli#setup) for more information.

<Callout type="warn">
    **Experimental**

    This feature is currently experimental and may not work perfectly. 
    If you run into any issues, please let us know by creating an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/General-Translation/gt-libraries/issues).
    In particular, note that some manual edits may be required.
</Callout>


<Callout>
    **Example**

    The CLI tool will wrap any JSX elements containing translatable content in `<T>` components.
    Each component will be given a unique `id` prop.

See the [`<T>` component documentation](/docs/usage/t) for more information.

```js title="app/page.js" copy
import { T } from "gt-next"; // [!code highlight]
import { Card, CardHeader, CardContent } from "@components/ui/Card";

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <T id="app.page.0"> // [!code highlight]
      {/* This text will be translated */}
      <b>Shakespeare&apos;s</b> quotes
      {/* Any arbitrary components and their children will also be translated */}
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>Hamlet</CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <p>&quot;To be, or not to be: that is the question...&quot;</p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
}
```
</Callout>

## Let's Try It Out!

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ Your app is now multilingual! Let's see it in action.

### See Your App in a Different Language

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Start by changing your preferred browser's language settings. This will
    change which language is displayed. 
    * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424) 
    * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
    * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)
    {/* TODO: safari */}
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Start your Next.js app in development mode.
    <Tabs items={["npm", "yarn"]}>
      <Tab value="npm">
      ```bash
      npm run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="yarn">
      ```bash 
      yarn run dev 
      ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at
    [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)). *If you want to switch
    languages, just select a different language in your browser settings and
    refresh the page.*
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
        **Browser Cookies**

        Check your browser's cookies for your app.
        General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
        The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
        Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
        refresh the page.

        How to check cookies:
        * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
        * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
        * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
        * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why do new languages take a long time to load?">
        **On-Demand Translation**

        You may notice when loading new languages, translations will take a few seconds to be displayed.
        This happens because your app has never been translated into that language before.
        We refer to this process as an "on-demand translation".
        All on-demand translations get cached in production environments,
        so a delay will only occur the first time a new language is requested.

        Luckily, this can be avoided by translating your app ahead of time for production deployments.
        Doing so does not increase bundle size and significantly reduces load times.
        See our instructions for how to [translate ahead of time](quickstart#cli-tool).
    </Accordion>

## Shipping to Production

### CLI Tool [#cli-tool]

In order to ship your app to production, you will need to run our CLI tool to parse your codebase and validate your content.

<Callout type="info">
    **Security**

    Due to the nature of client-sided rendering in React and Next.js client components,
    you must pre-authorize your content with the CLI tool before it can be translated.
    This means that you must run the CLI tool before deploying to your production environment.

</Callout>

Just run the following command in your project's root directory.
Make sure to add your **production** API key and project ID to your environment variables before you run this command.

```bash copy
npx gt-next-cli translate
```

Additionally, if your project has CI/CD, you should add this command to your deployment pipeline.

For more information, see the [CLI tool documentation](/docs/next/reference/cli#usage).

<Callout type="warn">
    **For Production Only!**

    This CLI tool is meant to *only be used for production deployments*.
    Make sure you have the correct API key and project ID in your environment variables,
    and make sure that you are translating the same content that is being used for production
    (i.e., the branch you are on when you run this command is the branch used for production).

</Callout>
