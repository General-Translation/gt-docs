title: Speedrun Next.js
description: Let's speedrun creating a new app and internationalizing it with GT.
---

## Overview

In this guide, we'll go over two things:
 - creating a new Next.js app
 - internationalizing it with General Translation

In total, this should take less than 10 minutes.


## Prerequisites

We assume that you either have experience using React in some capacity and are familiar with Typescript.

---

## Step 1: Create a new Next.js app

First, navigate to the directory of your choice in terminal and run the following command:

```bash copy
npx create-next-app next-quickstart --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --use-npm --src-dir
```

A set up wizard will appear, you can just select the default value for each option.


## Step 2: Install the `gt-next` library

Navigate to your Next.js project's root directory and run:

```bash copy
cd next-quickstart
npm i gt-next
```

## Step 3: Add your environment variables.

Navigate to your [GT Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/en-US/signin).
Go to the Dev Api Keys page on the nav bar and create a new API key and Project ID.
Then add them to your `.env` file.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

## Step 4: Add the provider

Wrap your app in the `<GTProvider>` component.
This only needs to happen once for your entire app.

```javascript title="src/app/layout.tsx" copy

import { GTProvider } from "gt-next"; // [!code highlight]

...

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        className={`${geistSans.variable} ${geistMono.variable} antialiased`}
      >
        <GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
        {children}
        </GTProvider> // [!code highlight]
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## Step 5: Translate your app

Okay, this is the step you have been waiting for.
Wrap your content in the `<T>` component and give it an `id` prop.

```javascript title="src/app/page.tsx" copy

import { T } from "gt-next"; // [!code highlight]

...

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <T id="home"> // [!code highlight]
        ...
    </T> // [!code highlight]
  );
};
```

## Step 6: Start your app

Your app is internationalized! ðŸŽ‰
Let's test it!


Let's change your browser's language settings.
 * Change your language in [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424)
 * Change your language in [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/use-firefox-another-language)
 * Change your language in [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/use-microsoft-edge-in-another-language-4da8b5e0-11ce-7ea4-81d7-4e332eec551f)

Start your Next.js app.
```bash copy
npm run dev
```

Open up your app in your preferred browser (usually at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

## Troubleshooting
<Accordions>
    <Accordion title="My app's language is not changing, even though I've changed my browser's language.">
        **Browser Cookies**

        Check your browser's cookies for your app.
        General translation uses cookies to store the user's language preference.
        The cookie is called `generaltranslation.locale`, and all you need to do is delete it.
        It will be under `localhost:3000`.
        Then, just double check you are using the desired perferred language and then
        refresh the page.

        After this, you won't have to worry about clearing the cookies.

        How to check cookies:
        * [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95647)
        * [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/delete-cookies-remove-info-websites-stored)
        * [Safari](https://support.apple.com/en-mn/guide/safari/sfri11471/16.0/mac/11.0)
        * [Edge](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/delete-cookies-in-microsoft-edge-63947406-40ac-c3b8-57b9-2a946a29ae09)
    </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Notes
 * Translate arbitrary jsx with the `<T>` component.
 * If translation is not working when you change your language, check your browser's cookies.
