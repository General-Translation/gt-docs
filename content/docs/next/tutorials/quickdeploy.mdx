## Overview

This is a short tutorial to help you deploy your Next.js app with GT.

We will do this in three steps:
<Steps>
  <Step>
    Choose which locales you want.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add your production API keys.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the translate command to your build script.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have followed the [Quick Start Guide](/docs/next/tutorials/quickstart) to set up your Next.js app with GT.

## Step 1: Choose your locales üåç

Start by navigating to your [dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/signin) and selecting **Project Locales** in the sidebar.

Under the **Current Locales** sections, select the locales you want to deploy and click **Save**.

## Step 2: Add your production API keys üîë

Add your **production** API key and Project ID to your production environment variables.

From your [dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/signin), go to **API Keys** in the sidebar.
Click on **Create API Key**, and add them to your production envrionment.

```bash copy
GT_API_KEY="YOUR_GT_API_KEY"
GT_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_GT_PROJECT_ID"
```

<Callout type="warn">
    **Protect Your API Keys!**

    Production keys should **only** ever be used in production.
    Likewise, development keys should **only** ever be used in development.
    *Never commit your API keys to a public repository!*
</Callout>

## Step 3: Add the translate command to your build script üèóÔ∏è

The next step is to add the translate command to your build script,
and specify the [locales](/docs/reference/supported-locales) that you would like to ship to production.

```json title="package.json" copy
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npx gt-next-cli translate --languages pt es && <YOUR_BUILD_COMMAND>"
  }
}
```
Here, we have added Portuguese and Spanish to our configuration.

<Callout>
  **Tip:** Because we have specified the locales in the build script, they have been recorded in the config file.
  You can edit the languages you want to support via the config file.
  Just remember to remove any hard coded languages from [`withGTConfig()`](/docs/next/api/config/withgtconfig).
</Callout>



That's it! You are now ready to deploy your Next.js with GT!
