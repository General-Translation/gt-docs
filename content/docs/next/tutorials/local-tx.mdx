title: Next.js Local Translations
description: Setup local translations for your Next.js app
---

## Overview

This guide assumes you have already followed most of the steps in the [Next.js Quickstart](/docs/next/tutorials/quickstart).
If you haven't, please do so first.

This guide will show you how to setup local translations for your Next.js app.

By default, your app will use General Translation's API and CDN to translate your app.


### What are local translations?

Local translations are JSON source files containing translations for your content that are stored in your project's codebase.

They can be used alongside, or in replacement of, GT as a translation provider. 

There are a few pros and cons to using local translations:

- **Pros:**
  - You do not need to rely on General Translation's services for your production app
    - Translations will load slightly faster (~100-200ms)
  - You can use your own translation provider

- **Cons:**
  - They may increase your bundle size
  - You will not be able to modify translations in production
    - With GT as a translation provider, you can modify translations in production without needing to re-publish your app. Changes go live within 1 minute.

  To enable on-demand translations in development and production, you will still need to use GT services.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add a `loadTranslation.[ts|js]` file under `./src` with the following content:

    <Tabs items={["ts", "js"]}>
      <Tab value="ts">
        ```ts title="src/loadTranslation.ts" copy
        export default async function loadTranslation(locale: string) {
          const t = await import(`../public/_gt/${locale}.json`);
          return t.default;
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="js">
        ```js title="src/loadTranslation.js" copy
        export default async function loadTranslation(locale) {
          const t = await import(`../public/_gt/${locale}.json`);
          return t.default;
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Callout>
      If you are not using a `src` directory, you can place this file at your project's root. Modify the filepaths accordingly.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Make sure you call `initGT()` in your `next.config.[ts|js]` file.

    ```ts title="next.config.[ts|js]" copy
    const withGT = initGT({});
    export default withGT(nextConfig);
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the flags `--no-publish` and `--translations-dir` to the `translate` command. 
    
    This will prevent translations from being published to the GT CDN, and will save them to the specified directory.

    ```bash
    npx gt-next-cli translate --no-publish --translations-dir ./public/_gt
    ```

    <Callout>
      In Next.js, files in the `public` directory are automatically included in the final bundle. 
      If you choose to use a different directory, please ensure that the files are included in the final bundle.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Your app will now only load translations from your local files.

You can customize `loadTranslation()` to also load translations from other sources, such as your database or your own CDN.
