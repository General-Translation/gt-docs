title: Next.js Local Translations
description: Setup local translations for your Next.js app
---

## Overview

This guide assumes you have already followed most of the steps in the [Next.js Quickstart](/docs/next/tutorials/quickstart).
If you haven't, please do so first.

This guide will show you how to setup local translations for your Next.js app.

By default, your app will use General Translation's API and CDN to translate your app.
This has many benefits, but also a few drawbacks:

- Users are required to use General Translation's services (API and CDN)
- In production, translations may take slightly longer to load (~100-200ms)

Local translations solve both of these problems. However, please note that there are also a few drawbacks:

- They may increase your bundle size
- Your project will not be able to use on-demand translations in production

<Callout type="warn">
  To enable on-demand translations in development, you will still need to use GT services.

### What are local translations?

Local translations are JSON source files containing translations for your content that are stored in your project's codebase.

They can be used alongside, or in replacement of, the GT CDN. 

There are a few pros and cons to using local translations:

- **Pros:**
  - You do not need to rely on General Translation's services for your production app
    - Translations will load slightly faster (~100-200ms)
  - You can use your own translation services

- **Cons:**
  - They may increase your bundle size
  - You will need to manually update translations as your app changes


## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Add a `loadTranslation.[ts|js]` file under `./src` or at your project's root with the following content:

    <Tabs items={["ts", "js"]}>
      <Tab value="ts">
        ```ts title="src/loadTranslation.ts" copy
        export default async function loadTranslation(locale: string) {
          const t = await import(`../public/_gt/${locale}.json`);
          return t.default;
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab value="js">
        ```js title="src/loadTranslation.js" copy
        export default async function loadTranslation(locale) {
          const t = await import(`../public/_gt/${locale}.json`);
          return t.default;
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Add the flag `--no-publish` to the `translate` command. 
    
    This will prevent translations from being published to the GT CDN.

    ```bash
    npx gt-next-cli translate --no-publish
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

That's it! Your app will now only load translations from your local files.

You can customize `loadTranslation()` to also load translations from other sources, such as your database or your own CDN.

See the `loadTranslation` function in the [API Reference](/docs/next/api/config/load-translation) for more information.
