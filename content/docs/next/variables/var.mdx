    **TL;DR**
    
    Anything inside of the `<Var>` component will not be translated.
    When working inside of a translation, use `<Var>` to wrap dynamic content and/or private information that should not be translated nor reformatted when switching between languages
    (i.e. names, emails, etc.).
</Callout>


## Overview
The `<Var>` component is used to display any content that should not be translated regardless of locale.
Think of names, emails, addresses, etc. that should remain the same regardless of the language the app is being rendered in.
The `<Var>` is your way of telling the GT libraries, "Hey, don't translate this part."

This guide will explore some simple examples for using `<Var>`, detail its interface, and discuss when and how to use it.

## Usage
The `<Var>` component is used inside of a `<T>` component or as a dictionary entry.

### Example
<Tabs items={['<T>', 'Dictionary (Advanced)']}>
    <Tab value="<T>">
        Inline implementations of `<Var>` are always inside of a `<T>` component.

        ```jsx title="Address.jsx" copy
            import { T, Var } from 'gt-next'

            export default function Address(address) {
                return (
                    <T id='address'>
                        {/* the content of <Var> will never be translated */}
                        Your current address is: <Var>{address}</Var> // [!code highlight]
                    </T>
                );
            }
        ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab value="Dictionary (Advanced)">
        You can read more about using dictionaries [here](/docs/next/advanced/dictionaries).


        ```jsx title="Address.jsx" copy
            import { useElement } from 'gt-next';
            import useAuth from 'hooks/useAuth';

            export default function Address(address) {

                // get user data
                const { user } = useAuth();

                // get the translation function
                // for server-side, instead use await getElement()
                const t = useElement(); // [!code highlight]

                return (
                    <p>
                        { 
                            // address_id refers to a (nested) key in the dictionary
                            // address_var tells the dictionary which <Var> component to choose
                            t( 'user.address_id', { address_var: user.address } ) // [!code highlight]
                        }
                    </p>
                );
            }
        ```
        ```jsx title="Dictionary.jsx" copy
            import { Var } from 'gt-next'

            const dictionary = {
                user: {
                    // user.address_id will now point to this JSX content we want to translate
                    // address_var will be replaced with the value of user.address
                    address_id: <> Your current address is: <Var name="address_var" /> </> // [!code highlight]
                },
            }

            export default dictionary;
        ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Reference

### Props

 
<TypeTable
  type={{
    "children?": {
        description:
            'The content to render inside the component. If provided, it will take precedence over value.',
        type: 'JSX.Element',
        optional: true,
        default: 'undefined',
    },
    "name?": {
        description:
            'Optional name for the variable, used for metadata purposes.',
        type: 'string',
        optional: true,
        default: 'undefined',
    },
    "value?": {
        description:
            'The default value to be displayed if children is not provided.',
        type: 'string',
        optional: true,
        default: 'undefined',
    },
}}
/>

### Returns
`JSX.Element` containing the content that should not be translated.

## When should I use `<Var>`?
When deciding to use a `<Var>` component, its easiest to ask if your content falls into two (somewhat overlapping) categories:
[*dynamic content*](var#dynamic-content) and [*private information*](var#private-information).

### Dynamic Content [#dynamic-content]
Dynamic content is any content that can change based on the user, context, environment, etc. and should not be translated.
A good example would be a user's email address and name.
Such items are (1) not likely to need translation when your app is being rendered in a different language and (2) can vary (in this case between each user).

```jsx title="Greeting.jsx" copy
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next'

export default function Greeting(name) {
    return (
        <T id='greeting'>
            Hello, <Var>{name}</Var>!
        </T>
    );
}
```

As far as translation goes this has two benefits:
1. You do not have to create a translation for every possible name.
    * Using `<Var>`, we only generate one translation that essentially would look like this:
        * \`¡Hola, $\{name\}!\`
    * If we do not use `<Var>`, we would have to perform an on-demand translation for every unique name:
        * "¡Hola, Alice!", "¡Hola, Bob!", "¡Hola, Charlie!", "¡Hola, David!", ...
2. You also don't have to worry about the names themselves changing into a translated form of their name: (i.e. "¡Hola, Alicia!", "¡Hola, Roberto!", ...).

As you can see, the `<Var>` component should be used to wrap any contents that should remain the same regardless of locale.
This way, we avoid the need to create translations for every possible value of the dynamic content.

### Private information [#private-information]
The `<Var>` component is also useful for displaying private information.

```jsx title="PrivateInfo.jsx" copy
import { T, Var } from 'gt-next'

export default function PrivateInfo(email) {
    return (
        <T id='private-info'>
            Your email address is <Var>{email}</Var>.
        </T>
    );
}
```
The children of the `<Var>` component will not be translated.
Its contents will never be passed to the General Tranlsation API.
Its contents will not be distrubuted to the CDN.

By wrapping private information in a `<Var>` component, you can ensure that the information is not sent to the General Translations API.
<Callout>
    **Exceptions**

    The exceptions to the statement above is (1) in the case of a nested `<T>` component used inside of a `<Var>` component (ie, the children of the nested `<T>` component will be translated)
    or (2) when data is passed intentionally to our API via some other means within a child of the `<Var>` component (i.e., a fetch call).
    However, this is not the intended use of the `<Var>` component nor the General Translations API and doing so can harm load times and performance.

    You can read more about nesting GT components [here](/docs/next/t). {/* TODO: add a page about nesting components */}

## Further Reading
Often times, we have private information and dynamic content that should be reformatted when switching between locales.
For such cases, we have the `<Num>`, `<DateTime>`, and `<Currency>` components.
These components handle reformatting information.
