## Do I own my translations?

**Yes.**

## What are tokens?

<Callout type="info">We charge for our services based on the length, in tokens, of what you input. We never charge based on the length of what we output.</Callout>

When text is sent to [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com) APIs, it is broken down into chunks called *tokens*.
Think of tokens as small pieces of your input text, like words or parts of words, that an AI model uses to understand and translate your content.

> A helpful rule of thumb is that one token generally corresponds to ~4 characters of text for common English text. This translates to roughly Â¾ of a word (so 100 tokens ~= 75 words).

For example, the string `Hello, world!` has 13 characters, and 4 tokens: `Hello`, `,`, ` world`, and `!`.

General Translation's cloud services charge by the token. We currently tokenize with OpenAI's `tiktoken`, which is the same tokenizer used by [GPT-4](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4/). You can explore this tokenizer [here](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer).

Tokens help us measure the amount of text we translate for you, ensuring that you only pay for what you use.
