# Setting environment variables

An API key is a 36-character string beginning `gtx-` which is used to authenticate your app with our cloud translation service. Create one on the [API Keys](https://www.generaltranslation.com/dashboard/redirect/api-keys) page.

Keep your API key somewhere safe and secret.

Then copy your Project ID, which can be found on the Dashboard:

![Code copy container entitled "projectID"](/screenshots/project_id.jpeg)

Set two environment variables:

```.env copy
GT_API_KEY=""
GT_PROJECT_ID=""
```

- For `GT_API_KEY`, use your API key.
- For `GT_PROJECT_ID`, use your Project ID.

In [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) this is done by editing `.env.local`. 
In other frameworks, such as Express.js, use a package like [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv).
