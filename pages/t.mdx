# Using `t()`

`t()` translates an item from a `gt-next` or `gt-react` [dictionary](/dictionaries) into the user's preferred language.

<Tabs items={['gt-next', 'gt-react']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
    ## `getLocale()`

    `getLocale()` can be imported anywhere in your app. When you use `getLocale()` in client components (components marked `'use client'` or their children), they must be the descendants of a [`<GTProvider>`](/provider).

    ```javascript copy
    import { getGT } from 'gt-next'

    export default function MyComponent() {
        const t = getGT();
        return (
            <div>
                {t('hello')}
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

    <Callout type="warning">
        In [server components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), `getGT()` is a normal function. However, in [client components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), `getGT()` is a React hook and follows the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks). 
        For this reason, we recommend you use `getGT()` as if it were a React hook everywhere, especially if you are not sure whether your component will be rendered on the client or the server.
    </Callout>

    `getGT()` takes an optional `id` string. This is used as a prefix for items in the dictionary.
    For example, if you write:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = getGT('dashboard')
    return t('welcome')
    ```
    This would be equivalent to:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = getGT()
    return t('dashboard.welcome')
    ```
    

    ### `useGT()`

    If you want to ensure a translation is only accessed on the client, you can import the `useGT()` hook from `gt-next/client`.
    ```javascript copy
    import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client'
    ```

    `useGT()` is a client-side React hook. It will throw an error if it is used in a server component or outside of a `<GTProvider>`. Otherwise, it is equivalent to `getGT()`.

    <Tabs.Tab>
    ## `useGT()`

    `t()` can be accessed in the descendants of [`<GTProvider>`](/react#provider) with the `useGT()` hook.

    ```javascript copy
    import { useGT } from 'gt-react'

    export default function MyComponent() {
        const t = useGT();
        return (
            <div>
                {t('hello')}
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```

    `useGT()` takes an optional `id` string. This is used as a prefix for items in the dictionary.
    For example, if you write:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = useGT('dashboard')
    return t('welcome')
    ```
    This would be equivalent to:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = useGT()
    return t('dashboard.welcome')
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

    This is an advanced feature which you probably only need if you're using [functional dictionary entries](/dictionaries#functions) in the client-side of `gt-next`
