# Dictionaries

<Callout type="info">
    If you don't want to use a dictionary or you want a dynamically translating component (which translates every time the page loads), use the [`<T>`](/gt-next/inline) wrapper.
</Callout>

Keeping translatable content in a single `.json` or `.js` file is a common technique in web app development.
Using a single dictionary allows for easier management of translations and ensures consistency across the application.

Uniquely, General Translation dictionaries don't just support strings. **You can write content in JSX too!**
This means you can usually copy and paste the content of your components directly into a dictionary.

Your dictionary is a JavaScript object, **which should be the default export of a file called `dictionary.js`** (or `.jsx`, `.tsx` etc.). The key of each entry is the `id` string, and the value is the default language (usually English) translatable content.

<Callout>
    `id`s should be lower case, so: `"example_one"` is a valid `id`, but `"exampleOne"` isn't.
</Callout>

## JSX

You can write [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) in your dictionaries, just like you would in the return statement of a React component.

```jsx copy
const dictionary = {
    "greeting": <p>Hello, world</p>
}
export default dictionary;
```

In this example, `<p>Hello, world</p>`, or its translation, would be rendered when you call the `t()` function with the corresponding `id`:

```js copy
t("greeting") // returns <p>Hello, world</p>
```

The JSX you write can be arbitrarily nested, and can contain class names and other values.

```jsx copy
const dictionary = {
    "greeting_two": (
        <p className="text-green">
            <b>Hello</b>, <i><span id="world-string">world</span></i>
        </p>
    )
}
export default dictionary;
```

You can also import complex components into your dictionaries:

```javascript copy
import Button from './Button'

const dictionary = {
    "button": <Button>Click me!</Button>
}

export default dictionary;
```

### Variables

In your dictionary, you can use the `<Var>` component to signify a variable. Variables won't be translated and can be supplied at runtime like:

```javascript copy
import { Var } from 'gt-next'

export default {
    "welcome": <>Welcome to our site, <Var name="firstname"/>!</>
}
```

```javascript copy
const firstname = "Alice"
t("welcome", { firstname }) // <>Welcome to our site, Alice!<>
```

The four available variable types are: `<Var>`, `<Num>` for numbers, `<DateTime>` for dates and times, and `<Currency>` for currencies.
To learn more, see [Variables](/dictionaries/variables).

## Strings

You can also write strings in dictionaries. These are translated as strings:

```javascript copy
export default {
    "string_example": "This is a string!",
    "jsx_example": <p>You can write strings alongside JSX</p>
}
```

```javascript
t("string_example") // returns "This is a string!"
```

### Variables

To include a variable in a string, include the name in braces (`{}`).
For example:

```js copy
"greeting": "Welcome to our site, {firstname}!"
```

Then use the `t()` function like:

```js copy
t("greeting", { firstname: "Alice" }) // "Welcome to our site, Alice!"
```

### `^` as an escape character

To include the `{` or `}` characters in a string, use the escape character `^`:

```js
"with_escaped_brace": "Many programming languages use braces like ^{ and ^}"
```

```js
t("with_escaped_brace") // Does not display the ^ characters
```

To display a single `^` character in a string, escape it by writing `^^`. (To display `^^`, write `^^^` and so on.)

### Variable types in strings

To include types in a string variable, add the type you need after a comma, within the braces:

```js
"example_with_currency": "This product costs {cost, currency}"
```

```js
t("example_with_currency", { cost: 10 })
```

## Nested dictionaries

## Metadata 

Metadata in General Translation dictionaries are used to add additional context, and specify plural forms and variable options. 
*To add metadata to an entry, write an array, where the first item is the translatable content, and the second is a JavaScript object.*
For example:

```javascript copy
const dictionary = {
    "entry_with_metadata": ["How are you?", { context: "Translate informally" }]
}
export default dictionary;
```

In this example, the string `"How are you?"`, is given the metadata object `{
    "context": "Translate informally"
}`.

### Context

Context is a natural language string used to provide additional instructions to the AI translation model. 
For example, in some languages, there is a formal and informal way to say "you", and you might want to specify that `"How are you?"` should be translated informally.

<Callout type="unmarked">
    ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸: `"How are you?"`
    â†’ <br/>
    ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª: `"Wie geht es Ihnen?"`

    ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸: `["How are you?", { "context": "Translate informally" }]` 
    â†’ <br/> 
    ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª: `"Wie geht es dir?"`
</Callout>

Context can also be used to specify a word with a double meaning:

```javascript copy
export default {
    "plans_link": [<a href='/plans'>Plans</a>, { context: `as in, "Payment Plans"` }]
}
```

To prevent abuse, context can be a maximum of `512` characters.

### Plurals

To render a different translation depending on whether a variable is singular or plural, 
add one of the following plural forms to metadata:

`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, `other`, `singular`, `dual`, `plural`

Generally, English content should only have two forms, `singular`, and `plural`:

```javascript copy
import { Num } from 'gt-next'

export default {
    "message_count": [
        <p>You have <Num/> new messages.</p>,
        {
            "singular": <p>You have one new message.</p>
        }
    ]
}
```

When you pass plural entries to `t()`, they require an `n` number to determine which form to take:

```javascript copy
t("message_count", { n: 1 }) // <p>You have one new message</p>
t("message_count", { n: 2 }) // <p>You have 2 new messages</p>
```

To learn more, see [Plurals](/dictionaries/plurals).

### Variable options

<Callout type="warning">
    In most cases, it's better to use JSX with a variable component like [`<Num>`](/dictionaries/variables#num-datetime-and-currency) and pass an `options` prop.
</Callout>

If you need to write a string with a number, date, or currency variable which needs options, you can add `variablesOptions` to your metadata object. 
`variablesOptions` is a JavaScript object where the keys are the names of variables and the values are the formatting options.

For example:

```javascript copy
export default {
    "user_score": ["Your score was {score, num}!", { variablesOptions: { score: { style: "percent" }}}]
}
```
