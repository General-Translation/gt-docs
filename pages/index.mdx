Our products:

- `gt-react`, an internationalization ("i18n") library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:

- **Translates automatically and on-demand** â€” once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages.
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

## Quickstarts
