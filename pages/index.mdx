# General Translation

Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com).

We publish internationalization ("i18n") libraries for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) apps.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    **React**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-react
    ```
    **Next.js**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-next
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    **React**
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-react
    ```
    **Next.js**
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-next
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages. You can write [dictionaries](/dictionaries) in full JSX or use inline wrappers like [`<T>`](/inline).

Additionally, `gt-next`:
- **Translates automatically** — once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

## How does it work?

Here's how `gt-next` works when the default language of your app ([`defaultLocale`](/config#defaultlocale))  is English (`en-US`):

- **For English-speaking users, nothing changes.** No data is ever sent to us and your site is rendered as normal.

- When a non-English language user visits your site, the library checks our cache. The cache is global and fast — typical response time is double digit milliseconds.

- If a cached translation exists, the library reconciles it with the original structure of the page (handling things like [plurals](/t#plurals) and [variables](/t#variables)) and displays the translated site.

- By default, the server fetches translations and then either renders them with [SSR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering#rendering-environments) or provides them to the client with [`<GTProvider>`](/next#provider). Entirely client-side Next.js apps should use [`gt-react`](/react#provider).

- You can use the [CLI](/dictionaries/cli) to update your remote dictionary automatically, e.g. whenever you push to a remote Git repo. Translations are usually available in less than a minute.

## What happens if a translation doesn't exist?

This can happen if:
- You never created a remote dictionary for the language your user is requesting.
- You've changed an item in your local (default language) dictionary without updating your remote one.
- A translation is not ready yet.

If no cached translation exists, we'll perform a translation on-demand. This translation will be streamed via your server to your user within a few seconds.

<Callout type="info">
**What this looks like:** the rest of the page loads, with your translated component loading in a few seconds later. The second time a user visits your page, the new translation will be cached, so it should load like any other component.
