# General Translation

Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com), a collection of libraries and cloud services which make working with languages easy!

- `gt-react` is an internationalization ("i18n") library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:

- **Translates automatically and on-demand** â€” once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages.
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

See a [demo](https://www.generaltranslation.com/demo) in action. Or access our cloud services at [www.generaltranslation.com](https://www.generaltranslation.com).

## `gt-react` Quickstart 

This guide describes how to add `gt-react` to a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project which is using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router). See quickstarts for other frameworks [here](/guides).

### Set up your account

First, sign in to the General Translation [Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/dashboard) using an existing Google or GitHub account. On the Dashboard, add billing information via Stripe:

![Button with "Add Payment Method"](/screenshots/stripe.jpeg)

Check out our current pricing [here](https://www.generaltranslation.com/pricing). You will only be charged for what you use, and never for content in your default language. If you have any questions about billing, please [get in touch](mailto:archie@generaltranslation.com)! 

Once billing information has been added to your project, you can create API keys. An API key is a 36-character string beginning `gtx-` which is used to authenticate your app with our cloud translation service. Create one on the Dashboard:

![Button with "Create API Key"](/screenshots/create_api_key.jpeg)

Keep your API key safe and secret.

### Set up your local environment

Navigate to your existing Next.js app, or follow the instructions [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) to create a new one.

In your local environment, usually `.env.local`, set two environment variables:

```.env copy
GT_API_KEY=""
GT_PROJECT_ID=""
```

- For `GT_API_KEY`, use the API key you created earlier.
- For `GT_PROJECT_ID`, use the `projectID` found on the Dashboard.

### Install the library

To install `gt-react`, open your project and run: 

``` copy
npm i gt-react
```

### Internationalization

In the Next.js App Router, components are Server Components by default. The best way to internationalize these components is with `<I18N>`:

```js copy
import { I18N } from 'gt-react/next'
```

`<I18N>` is a server-only component that surrounds any text or tags you'd like to be internationalized. For example:


```js copy
import Link from 'next/link'
import { I18N } from 'gt-react/next'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <I18N>
            <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>This site contains nested tags.</li>
                <li>Some tags are <b>bold</b>, some are <i>italicized</i>.</li>
                <li>There can be <span className="text-green">tags within tags within</span> tags.</li>
                <li>On <Link href="/">this page</Link>, simple children of any type of tag will still be translated.</li>
            </ul>
        </I18N>
    )
}
```

**That's it! The page is ready to go in dozens of languages.**

### How it works

Here's how it works when your default language is English:

- **For English-speaking users, nothing changes.** No data is ever sent to us and your site is rendered as normal.

- The first time a non-English language user visits your site, we use a cloud-based AI model to translate your content into their preferred browser language.

- Initially, an English version of your page is then served to the user, so that there's no noticeable latency. When the translated content is ready, usually within a few seconds, it replaces the English content on the page.

- This is known as the "replace" render method, but `gt-react` can also be [configured](/gt-react/config) to "hang" the page while the translation loads, or to render the translation only when the page is accessed in future.

- General Translation then caches your translations to serve to subsequent non-English-speaking users, who only ever receive the page in their chosen language. Data is stored globally, and usually available in fewer than 100ms.

- Whenever you update the children of the `<I18N>` component, it registers the new, uncached content. Translated content that is still valid is served, alongside the new content in English. Just like when the entire page needed to be translated, the new content replaces the English as soon as it's ready, and is cached for the next user.

### Next steps

- Check the [Reference guide](/reference) for an overview of all the functions in the `gt-react` library.

- Change how translated text is rendered, the default language, or which languages are approved for translation, by [configuring](/gt-react/config) with `gt_config.json`.

- Learn about the [parameters](/gt-react/server/i18n#props) of the `<I18N>` component, including `id` and `page`.

- Learn how to translate [Client Components](/gt-react/client) with `<GTProvider>`.

- Within the `<I18N>` tag, [stop components being translated](/gt-react/variables/variables/private) by marking them as `<Private>` or `<Variable>`.

- Learn about how to [internationalize variables](/gt-react/variables), including the `<Numeric>` and `<Value>` components.
