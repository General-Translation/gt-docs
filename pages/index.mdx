Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com). 

We publish developer libraries for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) apps which automate your entire internationalization ("i18n") stack.

- Setup is simple, with no need for complex rewrites of your project.
- Translations ship in seconds and load in milliseconds.
- UI gets translated in context by powerful AI models.

## Get started

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'React']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Follow the [Quickstart](/gt-next/quickstart) guide to ship your first translations.

    **npm**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-next
    ```
    **yarn**
    ```bash copy
    yarn add gt-next
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
    Follow the [Quickstart](/gt-react/quickstart) guide to ship your first translations. 
    
    **npm**
    ```bash copy
    npm i gt-react
    ```
    **yarn**

    yarn add gt-react
    ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Why choose General Translation?

**General Translation builds the entire i18n stack**, from developer libraries, to AI translations, to the infrastructure that serves your translations.
Because we built the whole stack from scratch, our libraries can:

#### Translate entire React components, not just strings

#### Support translated content inline or in dictionaries

#### Work across both client and server components

With first class support for the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and [React Server Components](https://react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components).

#### Support on-demand translation

(Experimental, currently `gt-next` only.)
