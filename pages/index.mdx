# General Translation

Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com).

Our products:

- `gt-react`, an internationalization ("i18n") library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:

- **Translates automatically and on-demand** â€” once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages.
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

## Quickstarts

- [Next.js App Router](/next)

## How it works

Here's how `gt-react` works when your default language is English:

- **For English-speaking users, nothing changes.** No data is ever sent to us and your site is rendered as normal.

- The first time a non-English language user visits your site, we use a cloud-based AI model to translate your content into their preferred browser language.

- The English version of your page is served to your user. When the translated content is ready, usually within a few seconds, it is rendered on the page, replacing the English content.

- This is known as the "replace" render method, but `gt-react` can also be [configured](/gt-react/config) to handle the initial translation delay differently. Other options include serving web pages with the text still loading, hanging the page while the translation loads, or rendering the translation only on the second page access.

- General Translation then caches your translations to serve to subsequent non-English-speaking users, who only ever receive the page in their chosen language. Data is stored globally, and usually available in fewer than 100ms.

- Whenever you update the children of the `<T>` component, it registers the new, uncached content. Translated content that is still valid is served, alongside the new content in English. Just like when the entire page needed to be translated, the new content replaces the English as soon as it's ready, and is cached for the next user.
