# General Translation

Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com), a collection of libraries and cloud services which make working with languages easy!

- `gt-react` is an internationalization library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications. 

Unlike other libraries, `gt-react` translates entire React components, not just strings. It works in both client and server components. And once it's connected to our cloud service, internationalization is automatic â€” your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed. See a [demo](https://www.generaltranslation.com/demo) in action.

- `generaltranslation` is the http client and language infrastructure library for `gt-react`.
- You can sign up for cloud services at [www.generaltranslation.com](https://www.generaltranslation.com)!

## `gt-react` Quickstart 

This guide describes how to add `gt-react` to a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project which is using the [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs#app-router-vs-pages-router). See quickstarts for other frameworks [here](/guides).

### Set up your account

First, sign in to the General Translation [Dashboard](https://www.generaltranslation.com/dashboard) using an existing Google or GitHub account. On the Dashboard, add billing information via Stripe:

![Button with "Add Payment Method"](/screenshots/stripe.jpeg)

Check out our current pricing [here](https://www.generaltranslation.com/pricing). You will only be charged for what you use, and never for content in your default language. If you have any questions about billing, please [get in touch](mailto:archie@generaltranslation.com)! 

Once billing information has been added to your project, you can create API keys. An API key is a 36-character string beginning `gtx-` which is used to authenticate your app with our cloud translation service. Create one on the Dashboard:

![Button with "Create API Key"](/screenshots/create_api_key.jpeg)

Keep your API key safe and secret.

### Set up your local environment

Navigate to your existing Next.js app, or follow the instructions [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) to create a new one.

In your local environment, usually `.env.local`, set two environment variables:

```.env copy
GT_API_KEY=""
GT_PROJECT_ID=""
```

- For `GT_API_KEY`, use the API key you created earlier.
- For `GT_PROJECT_ID`, use the `projectID` found on the Dashboard.

### Install the library

To install `gt-react`, open your project and run: 

```shell copy
npm i gt-react
```

### Internationalization

In the Next.js App Router, components are Server Components by default. The best way to internationalize these components is with `<I18N>`:

```js copy
import { I18N } from 'gt-react/next'
```

`<I18N>` is a server-only component that surrounds any text or tags you'd like to be internationalized. For example:


```js copy
import Link from 'next/link'
import { I18N } from 'gt-react/next'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <I18N>
            <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>This site contains nested tags.</li>
                <li>Some tags are <b>bold</b>, some are <i>italicized</i>.</li>
                <li>There can be <span className="text-green">tags within tags within</span> tags.</li>
                <li>On <Link href="/">this page</Link>, simple children of any type of tag will still be translated.</li>
            </ul>
        </I18N>
    )
}
```

**That's it! That page is ready to go in dozens of languages.**

If you ever change the text or structure of this page, it will translate again.

### Next steps

- Change how translated text is rendered, the default language, or which languages are approved for translation, by [configuring](/gt-react/gt_config) with `gt_config.json`.

- Learn about the [parameters](/gt-react/I18N#props) of the `<I18N>` component, including `id` and `page`.

- Learn how to translate [Client Components](/gt-react/client) with `<GTProvider>`.

- Within the `<I18N>` tag, [stop components being translated](/gt-react/private) by marking them as `<Private>`.

- Learn about how to [internationalize variables](/gt-react/variables), including the `<Numeric>` and `<Branch>` components.
