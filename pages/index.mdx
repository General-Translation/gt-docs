# General Translation

Welcome to the docs for [General Translation](https://www.generaltranslation.com), a collection of libraries and cloud services which make working with languages easy!

- `gt-react` is an internationalization ("i18n") library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:

- **Translates automatically and on-demand** â€” once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages.
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

See a [demo](https://www.generaltranslation.com/demo) in action. Or access our cloud services at [www.generaltranslation.com](https://www.generaltranslation.com).
