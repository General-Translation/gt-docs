Our products:

- `gt-react`, an internationalization ("i18n") library for [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) applications.

Unlike other i18n stacks, `gt-react`:

- **Translates automatically and on-demand** — once connected to our cloud service, your app will instantly support dozens of languages, no extra work needed.
- **Translates entire React components, not just strings.** So there's no need to rewrite your site to accomodate new languages. You can write [dictionaries](/dictionaries) in full JSX or use inline wrappers like [`<T>`](/server/t-component) and [`<Plural>`](/server/plural).
- **Works across both client and server components**, with first-class support for Next.js App Router and React Server Components.

## Quickstarts

- [Reference sheet for AI](/ai-reference) - copy and paste into your favorite chat model and ask it to set up `gt-react` for you!

- [Next.js App Router](/next)

## How does `gt-react` work?

Here's how `gt-react` works when your [`defaultLocale`](/config) is English (`en-US`):

- **For English-speaking users, nothing changes.** No data is ever sent to us and your site is rendered as normal.

- When a non-English language user visits your site, the library checks our cache. The cache is global, and fast — typical response time is 50 ms.

- If a cached translation exists, the library reconciles the non-English content with the structure of what it's been asked to translate, and serves the page.

- If no cached translation exists, and the language requested is in [`approvedLanguages`](/config), the library sends a request to our server to translate the content into a new language.

- Once the translation is complete, it is cached, and returned to your site. Newly translated content is displayed according to your chosen [`renderMethod`](/config/rendering).

- Whenever you your content changes, your server will send a request to ours for a new translation. Previously translated content is served while a new translation is prepared using your desired `renderMethod`.

- If you're a paid customer, [Translation Replication](/faqs#translation-replication) means your new content will be translated into all your existing languages automatically, with no further requests needed.

- This "just-in-time" method of translation means you only pay for the languages and content people actually see.

- However, if you'd prefer not to use just-in-time translation, there is a [CLI tool](/dictionaries/cli-tool) to translate your dictionary before you ship.
