# How does `gt-react` work?

Here's how `gt-react` works when your [`defaultLocale`](/config) is English (`en-US`):

- **For English-speaking users, nothing changes.** No data is ever sent to us and your site is rendered as normal.

- When a non-English language user visits your site, the library checks our cache. The cache is global, and fast â€” typical response time is 50 ms.

- If a cached translation exists, the library reconciles the non-English content with the structure of what it's been asked to translate, and serves the page.

- If no cached translation exists, and the language requested is in [`approvedLanguages`](/config), the library sends a request to our server to translate the content into a new language.

- Once the translation is complete, it is cached, and returned to your site. Newly translated content is displayed according to your chosen [`renderMethod`](/config/rendering).

- Whenever you your content changes, your server will send a request to ours for a new translation. Previously translated content is served while a new translation is prepared using your desired `renderMethod`.

- If you're a paid customer, [Translation Replication](/faqs#translation-replication) means your new content will be translated into all your existing languages automatically, with no further requests needed.

- This "just-in-time" method of translation means you only pay for the languages and content people actually see.

- However, if you'd prefer not to use just-in-time translation, there is a [CLI tool](/dictionaries/cli-tool) to translate your dictionary before you ship.

## Billing

- We only charge for translations, not caching.

- Translations only happen *once* per piece of unique content.

- We charge based on the length, in [tokens](/faqs/tokens), of what you input. We never charge based on the length of what we output.

For example, if the only translation you needed was a single [`<T>`](/server/t-component) containing the string `Hello, world!`:

```javascript
import { T } from '@i18n'

export default function Page() {
    return (
        <T id='greeting'>
            Hello, world
        </T>
    )
} 
```

Then we would charge you for four tokens: `Hello`, `,`, ` world`, and `!`.

## Translation replication

Translation replication is a powerful feature of our paid plans. It is not available for free customers.

With translation replication, whenever an update to your site is translated into one language, it is automatically translated into all your site's existing languages. Similarly, whenever a user visits your site in a new language, translations are made in the background not just for the page they visit, but all previously translated pages of your web app. This means that for the vast majority of users and languages, displaying your site in another language is completely seamless.
