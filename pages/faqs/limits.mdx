# Limits

<Callout type="info">Translations only happen once per piece of unique content.</Callout>

The free plan has [token](/faqs/tokens) limits to ensure that every customer can access our services fairly.

When these limits are hit, our cloud service will reject new translation requests. The API will return a HTTP `429` error code, and we will send you an email prompting you to upgrade to a paid plan. This will *not* break your website, but it will prevent your content from being displayed in new languages. 

Translations you have made previously will continue to be available.
