# Variables

Sometimes you need to include content that shouldn't be translated but could change in your content. 
For example, imagine you are displaying a welcome page. You might want to address your user by their first name:

```javascript
const firstname = "Alice" // or "Bob", "Charlie", etc.
return (
    <p>
        Welcome to our site, {firstname}!
    </p>
)
```

## `<Var>` 

In your dictionary, you can use the `<Var>` component to signify a variable which will be translated around.

```javascript copy
// dictionary.js

import { Var } from 'gt-next' // or 'gt-react'

const dictionary = {
    "my_id": <>Welcome to our site, <Var name="firstname"/>!</>
}

export default dictionary;
```

`<Var>` takes an optional `name` prop which specifies the variable name. To supply a variable with [`t()`](/t), you can write:

```javascript copy
const firstname = "Alice" // or "Bob", "Charlie", etc.
return t('my_id', { firstname })
```

The children of the `<Var>` component will remain untranslated and can change without forcing a retranslation. Anything you include as the children of the `<Var>` in the dictionary will be the default value, rendered if no value is supplied in the `t()` function.

```javascript copy
// dictionary.js

import { Var } from 'gt-next' // or 'gt-react'

const dictionary = {
    "my_id": <>Welcome to our site, <Var name="firstname">valued customer!</Var>!</>
}

export default dictionary;
```

## `<Num>`, `<DateTime>`, and `<Currency>`

Sometimes variables need to be localized in some way — for example, in US English (`en-US`) dates are written month first, with slashes: `MM/DD/YY`. In German (`de`) they are written day first, with periods: `DD.MM.YY`. In addition to `<Var>`, there are the specialized variable types `<Num>` for numbers, `<DateTime>` for dates, and `<Currency>` for currencies.

```javascript copy
// dictionary.js

import { Var, Num, DateTime, Currency } from 'gt-next' // or 'gt-react'

const dictionary = {
    "my_id": <>Welcome to our site, <Var name="firstname">valued customer!</Var>!</>,
    "num_example": <>You have <Num/> new messages.</>,
    "datetime_example": <>Today is <DateTime/>.</>,
    "currency_example": <>This product costs <Currency/>.</>
}

export default dictionary;
```

If a an entry in the dictionary has two variables, for example:

```js
{ 
    "two_var_example": <>The movie is called <i><Var name="movie"/></i> and a ticket costs <Currency name="price"/>.</> 
}
```

Then you would supply two values to `t()`:

```js
t('two_var_example', { movie: "Terminator 2: Judgement Day", price: 10 })
```

## Variable names

If no `name` prop is provided, variable components will default to the following names:

| Variable Type | Default Name |
|----------------|--------------|
| `<Var>`            | value        |
| `<Num>`           | n            |
| `<DateTime>`       | date         |
| `<Currency>`     | cost         |

This means that

```javascript
"datetime_example": <>Today is <DateTime/>.</>
```

Would be supplied a variable like:

```javascript
t("datetime_example", { date: new Date() })
```

## Variable options

The specialized variables `<Num>`, `<DateTime>`, and `<Currency>` take an `options` prop, which conforms to
the [`Intl.NumberFormatOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat) standard in the case of `<Num>` and `<Currency>`, and the [`Intl.DateTimeFormatOptions`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat) standards in the case of `<DateTime>`.

For example:

```js copy
// displays a percentage, rounded to a whole number
"num_example_two": (
    <>
        Your progress is about 
        <Num 
            name="count" 
            options={{style: "percent", maximumFractionDigits: 0}}
        />.
    </>
)
```

Additionally, the `<Currency>` component takes an optional `currency` prop which corresponds to an [ISO-4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217) currency code. 
By default, the currency is `USD` ($).

```js copy
// displays the price in euros (€), rounded to the nearest whole number
"currency_example_two": (
    <>
        This plan costs
        <Currency 
            currency="EUR"
            options={{maximumFractionDigits: 0}}
        />.
    </>
)
```

## Variables in strings

To include a variable in a string, include the name in braces (`{}`).
For example:

```js
"greeting": "Welcome to our site, {firstname}!"
```

Then use the `t()` function like:

```js
t("greeting", { firstname: "Alice" })
```

To include the `{` or `}` characters in a string, use the escape character `^`:

```js
"with_escaped_brace": "Many programming languages use braces like ^{ and ^}"
```

```js
t("with_escaped_brace") // Does not display the ^ characters
```

### Variable types in strings

To include types in a string variable, add the type you need after a comma, within the braces:

```js
"example_with_currency": "This product costs {cost, currency}"
```

```js
t("example_with_currency", { cost: 10 })
```

### Variable string options

Use [dictionary metadata](/dictionaries#metadata) to add advanced `Intl.NumberFormatOptions` and `Intl.DateTimeFormat` options to the variables within strings.
