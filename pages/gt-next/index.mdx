# `t()` function in `gt-next`

`t()` translates an item from a `gt-next` or `gt-react` [dictionary](/dictionaries) into the user's preferred language.
For example, if the user's browser is requesting Spanish (`es`):

```jsx
"greeting": <p>Hello, world!</p>
```

```js
t("greeting") // returns <p>¡Hola, mundo!</p>
```

## `getGT()`

`getGT()` can be imported anywhere in your app. When you use `getLocale()` in client components (components marked `'use client'` or their children), they must be the descendants of a [`<GTProvider>`](/gt-next/provider).

```javascript copy
import { getGT } from 'gt-next'

export default function MyComponent() {
    const t = getGT();
    return (
        <div>
            {t('greeting')}
        </div>
    )
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
    In [server components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), `getGT()` is a normal function. However, in [client components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components), `getGT()` is a React hook and follows the [Rules of Hooks](https://react.dev/reference/rules/rules-of-hooks). 
    For this reason, we recommend you use `getGT()` as if it were a React hook everywhere.
</Callout>

    `getGT()` takes an optional `id` string. This is used as a prefix for items in the dictionary.
    For example, if you write:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = getGT('dashboard')
    return t('welcome')
    ```
    This would be equivalent to:
    ```javascript copy
    const t = getGT()
    return t('dashboard.welcome')
    ```
    

### `useGT()`

If you want to ensure a translation is only accessed on the client, you can import the `useGT()` hook from `gt-next/client`.
```javascript copy
import { useGT } from 'gt-next/client'
```

`useGT()` is a client-side React hook. It will throw an error if it is used in a server component or outside of a `<GTProvider>`. Otherwise, it is equivalent to `getGT()`. 

## Parameters

`t(id: string, variables?: Record<string, any>, f?: Function): Promise<string | JSX.Element> | JSX.Element | string`

- **id**: `string`  
  The identifier for the localized string or JSX element. This ID is used to lookup the appropriate translation for the current language.

- **variables**: `Record<string, any>`  
  An object containing key-value pairs used to dynamically replace placeholders in the localized string or JSX element. The placeholders in the string should match the keys in this object.

- **f**: `Function`  
  An advanced feature which you probably only need if you're using [functional dictionary entries](/dictionaries#functions) in a client component and using `gt-next`.

## Return Types

`t()` returns a string, a JSX element, or a promise of either of those two types, depending on what you wrote in the dictionary. 

|          | Server component      | Client component      |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| String in dictionary  | `Promise<string>` | `string` |
| JSX in dictionary   | `Promise<JSX.Element>` | `JSX.Element` |

For example, if you use `t()` on the server to access a string, it will return a `Promise<string>`:

```js
"message": "Hello, world!"
```

```js copy
// server component
const translation = await t('message')
console.log(translation) // ¡Hola, mundo!
```
