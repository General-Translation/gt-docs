# Plurals

Imagine you wanted to translate a phrase that could be singular or plural. You could use a `<Num>` variable and render a translation conditionally, like: 

```javascript
"singular": <>I have one new message.</>
"plural": <>I have <Num/> new messages.</>
```

```javascript
t(n === 1 ? 'singular' : 'plural')
```

However, some languages have forms which don't exist in English, like the Arabic [dual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)).
`gt-react` and `gt-next` generate plural forms automatically, language-by-language.

The full list of forms which the library allows plurals to take is an extension of JavaScript's [`Intl.PluralRules`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/PluralRules): 

`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, `other`, `singular`, `dual`, `plural`

To indicate that an item is plural, use the `<Plural>` component and supply alternate forms with these names. For example:

```js
// Will display "You have 1 new message" when n is 1,
// and "You have {n} new messages" when n is plural.
// May display dual, paucal, null forms in other languages.
{  
    "messages": (
        <Plural singular={<p>You have <Num/> new message.</p>}>
            <p>You have <Num/> new messages.</p>
        </Plural>
    )
}
```

Plurals *require* an `n` parameter in the `t()` function. In this example:

```js
t('messages', { n: 1 }); // <p>You have 1 new message.</p>
t('messages', { n: 3 }); // <p>You have 3 new messages.</p>
```
