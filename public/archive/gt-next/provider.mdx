# `<GTProvider>`

**In the Next.js [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), components are server components by default.**
    This means they are executed on the server, and can perform server-specific actions like `async` API calls and accessing environment variables.

    Components which use client-side JavaScript, including React hooks like `useState()` and `useEffect()`, are client components. They must marked with [`'use client'`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components#using-client-components-in-nextjs) or the descendants of another client component.
   
    To use translations in client components, you must pass them from the server to the client using `<GTProvider>`. `<GTProvider>` uses React's [Context](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context) API to give its descendants access to translations and locale information.
    
    The following hooks are available to the children of `<GTProvider>`:

    - [`getGT()`](/gt-next): Used to initialize the `t()` function, which loads a translation from the dictionary.
    - [`getLocale()`](/gt-next/helpers#getlocale): Retrieves the user's current language as an [ISO-639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) language code.
    - [`getDefaultLocale()`](/gt-next/helpers#getdefaultlocale): Retrieves the application's default language as an ISO-639 language code.

    <Callout type="warning">
        **In Next.js, you should import `<GTProvider>` in a server component.** If you try using it in a client component, you will get the following error:
        "You're attempting to import `<GTProvider>` on the client. Are you sure you want to do this? It's better to import `<GTProvider>` in a file not marked `'use client'` so that it can fetch translations on the server. If you really need to put `<GTProvider>` on the client, import `<GTProvider>` from `'gt-next/client'` (not recommended in server-first apps)."
    </Callout>

    ### Using `<GTProvider>` with `id`

    If your dictionary is very large and you don't want to provide all of it in the server response, pass the optional `id` prop to `<GTProvider>`. 
    This will let you send a nested subset of your server-side dictionary to the client.


    ### Example

    ```javascript copy
    // dictionary.js

    import { Num } from 'gt-next'

    export default {
        "client": {
            "counting_text": <>The current count is <Num/>.</>,
            "click_me": "Click me!"
        }
    }
    ```

    ```javascript copy
    // page.js

    import { GTProvider } from 'gt-next'
    import MyClientComponent from './MyClientComponent'

    export default function Page() {

        // using GTProvider with the 'id' prop to pass only a subset of the dictionary to the client
        return (
            <main>
                <GTProvider id='client'>
                    <MyClientComponent />
                </GTProvider>
            </main>
        )
    }

    ```

    ```javascript copy
    'use client'

    import { useState } from 'react'
    import { getGT } from 'gt-next'

    export default function MyClientComponent() {

        const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

        const t = getGT();

        return (
            <div>
                <div>
                    {t('counting_text', { n: count })}
                </div>
                <div>
                    <button onClick={() => {setCount(prev => prev + 1)}}>
                        {t('click_me')}
                    </button>
                </div>
            </div>
        )
    }
    ```
